            <p> Washington's mission: In 1753 the imperial nations of France, Great Britain, and the
                Native Americans all claimed control of the Ohio Valley, the area encompassing
                present-day western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. Acting on orders from Governor
                Dinwiddie, twenty-one-year-old George Washington embarked upon a dangerous
                expedition north from Williamsburg to deliver a diplomatic message to the French
                ordering them to evactuate the region. Already the French had erected threee forts
                to reinforce their claim to the area: Fort Presque Isle (current day Erie, Pa), Fort
                LeBoeuf (Waterford, Pa), and Fort Machault/Venango (Franklin, Pa). During his
                journey to the French forts in the winter of 1753-54, young Washington encountered
                many hazards. Not only were there "excessive rains and vast quality of snow",
                Washington was almost shot by an Indian guide near current day Harmony, Pa, and
                nearly drowned in the icy waters of the Allegheny River near present-day Pittsburgh,
                Pa. When Washington returned to Williamsburg in January 1754, he reported to the
                governor that the French intended to remain entrenched in the Ohio Valley. This
                marked the beggining of the military struggle known globally as the Seven Year War
                and locally as the French and Indian War.</p>
