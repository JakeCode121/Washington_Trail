                <p> Washington's mission, in 1753, the imperial nations of France and Great Britain<br/>
                    and the Native Americans all claimed control of the Ohio Valley, the area<br/>
                    encompassing present-day western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. Acting on orders<br/>
                    from Governor Dinwiddie, twenty-one-year-old George Washington embarked upon a<br/>
                    dangerous expedition north from Williamsburg to deliver a diplomatic message to<br/>
                    the French ordering them to evactuate the region. Already the French had,<br/>  
                    erected threee forts to reinforce their claim to the area: Fort Presque Isle<br/>
                    (current day Erie, Pa), Fort LeBoeuf (Waterford, Pa), and Fort Machault<br/>
                    (Franklin, Pa). During his journey to the French forts in hte winter of 1753-54,<br/>
                    young Washington encountered many hazards. There were "excessive rains and vast<br/>
                    quality of snow." He was nearly shot by an Indian guide near current day<br/>
                    Harmony, Pa, and nearly drowned in the icy waters of the Allegheny River near<br/>
                    present-day Pittsburgh, Pa. When Washington returned to Williamsburg in January<br/>
                    1754, he reported to the governor that the French intended to remain entrenched<br/>
                    in the Ohio Valley. This marked the beggining of the military struggle known
                    globally <br/>as the Seven Year War and locally as the French and Indian War.</p>
