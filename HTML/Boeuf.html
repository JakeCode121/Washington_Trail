        <h1>Fort Le Boeuf</h1>Fort Le Boeuf (often referred to as Fort de
        la Rivière au Bœuf) was a fort established by the French during 1753 on a fork of French Creek (in the drainage area of the River Ohio), in
        present-day Waterford, in northwest Pennsylvania. The
        fort was part of a line that included Fort Presque Isle,
        Fort Machault, and Fort Duquesne. The fort was
        located about 15 miles (24 km) from the shores of Lake
        Erie, on the banks of LeBoeuf Creek, for which the fort was named. The
        French portaged supplies and trade goods from Lake Erie overland to Fort Le Boeuf. From there they traveled by raft and canoe
        down French Creek to the rivers Allegheny, Ohio and Mississippi. Today, the site of
        the
        fort is occupied by the Fort LeBoeuf Museum, operated by the Fort LeBoeuf Historical
        Society.
        <p>History Captain Paul
            Marin de la Malgue began construction on 11 July 1753; Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre began command of
            the fort on 3 December 1753. This fort
            was the second of a series of posts that the French
            built between spring 1753 and summer 1754 to assert their possession of the Ohio
            Country. These four posts Fort Presque Isle, Fort LeBoeuf, Fort
            Machault, and Fort Duquesne ran from Lake
            Erie to the Forks of the Ohio; they represented the last links of France's effort
            to
            connect its dominions in Canada with those in the Illinois Country and Louisiana. The English trading post of John Frazier, at
            Venango at the junction of French Creek and the Allegheny River(where Franklin is now located) was seized
            and occupied. Leaving a force to garrison the new posts, the French command returned
            to
            Canada for the winter.[2] Fort LeBoeuf (modern
            Waterford, Pennsylvania) guarded the southern end of the portage road between Lake
            Erie
            and French Creek, which flowed to the Allegheny River
            and ultimately to the River Ohio. It served as a French trading post and garrison
            until
            1759, when the capture of Fort Niagara forced the French to abandon the Ohio Country. </p>
        <p> Washington's mission: Robert
            Dinwiddie, the governor of
            Virginia, sent the 21-year-old George Washington to
            Fort Le Boeuf with seven escorts, in order to deliver a message to the French
            demanding that they leave the Ohio Country. Dinwiddie's initiative was in response to the French building
            forts in the Ohio Country. Washington took Christopher Gist along as his guide; during
            the
            trip, Gist saved the young Washington's life on two separate occasions. Washington and Gist arrived at Fort Le Boeuf on 11 December 1753. Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, commandant at Fort Le Boeuf, a tough veteran of the west, received Washington
            politely, but contemptuously rejected his blustering ultimatum. French Forts, 1753
            and 1754
            Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre gave Washington three days hospitality at the fort,
            and
            then gave Washington a letter for him to deliver to Dinwiddie. The letter ordered
            the
            Governor of Virginia to deliver his demand to the Major General of New France in the
            capital, Quebec City. During his stay, Washington noted that the fort had one
            hundred men, a large number of officers, 50 birch canoes and 70 pine canoes, many
            unfinished. He described the fort as on a south or west fork of French creek, near
            the
            water, and almost surrounded by it. Four houses composed the sides. The bastions were
            made
            of piles driven into the ground, standing more than 12 feet (3.7 m) high, and sharpened
            at
            the top. Port holes for cannon and loop-holes for small-arms were cut into the bastions.
            Each bastion mounted eight six-pound cannon and one four-pound cannon guarded the
            gate.
            Inside the bastions stood a guard-house, chapel, doctor's lodging and the commander's
            private stores. Outside the fort were several log barracks, some covered with bark,
            others
            with boards. In addition, there were stables, a smithy and other buildings. </p>
