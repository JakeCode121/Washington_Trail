            <p>WASHINGTON'S MISSION In 1753, the imperial nations of France and Great Britain and
                the Native Americans all claimed control of the Ohio Country,the area encompassing
                present-day western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio.Acting on orders from Virginia
                Governor Robert Dinwiddie, twenty-one-year-old George Washington embarked upon a
                dangerous expedition north from Williamsburg to deliver a diplomatic message to the
                French ordering them to evacuate the region. Already the French had erected three
                forts to reinforce their claim to the area: Fort Presque Isle (Erie, PA), Fort
                LeBoeuf (Waterford, PA), and Fort Machault (Franklin, PA). During his journey to the
                French forts in the winter of 1753-1754, young Washington encountered many hazards.
                There were "excessive rains and vast quantity of snow". He was nearly shot by an
                Indian guide near Harmony, PA, and nearly drowned in the icy waters of the Allegheny
                River near present-day Pittsburgh, PA. When Washington returned to Williamsburg in
                January 1754, he reported to the governor that the French intended to remain
                entrenched in the Ohio Country. This marked the beginning of the military struggle
                know as the French and Indian War. </p>
