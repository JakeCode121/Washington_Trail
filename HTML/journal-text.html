      <h1>Washington Journal</h1> The Journal of George
      Washington
      1754
      
      <p>In October,1753
         George Washington, a
         21-year-old major in the Virginia militia, volunteered to carry a letter from the
         governor
         of Virginiato theFrench
         commander of the forts recently built on the headwaters of theOhio River in northwestern Pennsylvania. The French had recently expanded their military
         operations from the Great Lakes into theOhio
         country, and had spent the summer of 1753
         building forts and roads along the Allegheny
         River,s with the design of linking their trade routes and sphere of
         influence down the Ohio to the Mississippi. Virginia governor  believed them to be in violation of treaties and
         claims that made those territories part ofVirginia and Pennsylvania as granted by the British Crown, and
         his letter to theFrench commander instructed him to cease, desist,
         and depart from those regions. </p>
      <p>
         Washingtonleft Williamsburg, Virginia on October 31st 1753and completed the
         round trip of more than 1,000 miles by horse, foot, canoe, and raft in about ten
         weeks. He was accompanied by Christopher
         Gist,an explorer and surveyor employed by the Ohio Company, by Jacob Van BraamJ a French Interpreter,s
         four Indian traders and baggage men, and various Indian delegations and
         guards, including , known as the “Half
         King.”
         Washington
         accomplished far more than the mere delivery of a letter: he practiced diplomacy to
         keep the Native leaders allied to the English cause; he interviewed French deserters
         and reported P on the extent of French military posts between New Orleans and the Great Lakes; he reconnoitered the
         Forks of the Ohio with an eye to the proper site
         for building a fort; and he inspected and reported on the construction of the new
         French forts and made estimates of their strength and preparations for the following
         year’s expeditions.</p>
      <p>When Washington
         arrived back in Williamsburg on
         January 16th 1754, Governor Dinwiddie
         immediately asked him to prepare a written report for the House of Burgesses.
         Dinwiddie then
         had this eport printed, and it became very popular reading. The Virginia legislature
         was so pleased with his mission and his report that they voted him a £50 reward. The
         Journal of Major George
         Washington was reprinted in various colonial newspapers as far away as
         Boston, and a British edition was issued in
         London later that same year, for which Washington sent materials for the preparation of a
         map.</p>
      <p> This online electronic text edition of the Journal is based on the first
         American edition published at Williamsburg
         in February 1754. It includes some
         annotations for the nonspecialist reader and a note on the text discussing the
         sources and the few emendations made. </p>
      <p>It is accompanied by 2 maps, attached as supplementary PDF files: one is a copy
         of the map that appeared with the London edition, showing the whole region from the
         Atlantic to the Mississippi, based on materials furnished by Washington; the other is a detail
         derived from the map accompanying Thomas
         Jefferson’s Notes on the State of Virginia
         (1787), showing the frontier region through which Washington travelled, between Cumberland&gt;(Md.) and Lake Erie. Of the two, the Jefferson map shows the geography with somewhat
         greater accuracy. </p>

         Washington, SENT BY THE Hon.ROBERT DINWIDDIE,Esq; His Majesty’s 
         Lieutenant-Governor, and Commander in Chief of
         VIRGINIA, TO THE COMMANDANT OF THE FRENCH FORCES ON O H I O. TO WHICH
         ARE ADDED, THE GOVERNOR’s LETTER, AND A TRANSLATION OF THE FRENCH OFFICER’S ANSWER.
         WILLIAMSBURG: Printed by
         William Hunter
         1754.
         </h3>
      <p>I was commissioned and appointed by the Honourable Robert Dinwiddie, Esq; Governor,&amp;c. of
         Virginia, to visit and deliver a Letter to the Commandant of
         the French Forces on the Ohio, and set out on the intended Journey the
         same Day; the next,s Iarrived at Fredericksburg, and
         engaged Mr. Jacob Van Bramm, to be
         my French Interpreter; and proceeded with him to Alexandria, where we provided Necessaries;from thence we went to Winchester and got Baggage, Horses, &amp;c. and from
         thence we pursued the new Road to Wills-Creek,
         where we arrived the November 14th.</p>
      <p>Here I engaged Mr. Gist to
         pilot us out, and also hired four others as Servitors,Barnaby Currin, and John MacQuire, Indian Traders, Henry Steward, and William
         Jenkins, and in Company with those Persons, left the Inhabitants the
         Day following.</p>
      <p>The excessive Rains and vast Quantity of Snow that had fallen, prevented our
         reaching .Mr. Frazier's an Indian Trader, at the
         Mouth of Turtle Creek, on Monongahela, till Thursday
         the 22d. We were informed here, that Expresses were sent a few Days ago
         to the Traders down the River, to acquaint them with the French General’s Death, and
         the Return of the major Part of the French Army into Winter Quarters.</p>
      <p> The Waters were quite impassable, without swimming our Horses; which obliged
         us to get the Loan of a Canoe from ,Frasier and to
         send Barnaby Currin, and Henry Steward, down Monongahela, with our Baggage, to meet us at the
         Forks of Ohio, about 10 Miles, to crossAligany . </p>
      <p> As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers, and
         the Land in the Fork, which I think exstremely
         well situated for a Fort, as it has the absolut Command of both Rivers. The Land at
         the Point is 20 or 25 Feet above the common Surface of the Water, and a considerable
         Bottom of flat, well-timbered Land all around it, very convesnient for Building: The
         Rivers are each a Quarter of a Mile, or more, across, and run here very near at
         right Angles: Aligany bearing N. E. and Monongahela S. E. the former of these two is a very
         rapid and swift running Water, the other deep and still, without any perceptible
         Fall. </p>
      <p> About two Miles from this, on the South East Side of the River, at the Place
         where the Ohio Company intended to erect a Fort, lives Shingiss, king of the Delawares; we call’d upon him, to
         invite him to Council at the Loggs Town.
         </p>
      <p> As I had taken a good deal of Notice Yesterday of the Situation at the
         Forks, my Curiosity led me to examine this more particularly, and
         I think it greatly inferior, either for Defence or Advantages;especially the
         latter;for a Fort at the Forks would be equally well situated onOhio, and have the entire Command of Monongahela, which runs up to our Settlements and is
         extremely well design’d for Water Carriage, as it is of a deep still Nature;
         besides, a Fort at the Fork might be built at a much less Expence, than at the other
         Place.——— </p>
      <p> Nature has well contrived the lower Place, for Water Defence; but the Hill
         whereon it must stand being about a Quarter of a Mile in Length, and then descending
         gradually on the Land Side, will render it difficult and very expensive, making a
         sufficient Fortification there.—The whole Flat upon the Hill must be taken in, or
         the Side next the Descent made extremely high;or else the Hill cut away: Otherwise,
         the Ensemy may raise Batteries within that Distance without being expos’d to a
         single Shot from the Fort. </p>
      <p> Shingiss attended us to the Loggs Town, where
         we arrived between Sun-setting and Dark, the 25th Day after I left Williamsburg: We travelled over some extreme good, and bad Land, to get
         to this Place. — </p>
      <p> As soon as I came into Town, I went to Monacatoocha (as the 
         Half King was out at his hunting Cabbin on little Beaver
         Creek, about 15 Miles off ) and inform’d him by my Indian Interpreter, that I was sent a Messenger to
         the French General; and was ordered to call upon
         the Sachems of the Six Nations, to acquaint them with
         it.—I gave him a String of Wampum, and a Twist of Tobacco, and desired him to send
         for the Half King;which he promised to do by a
         Runsner in the Morning, and for other Sachems.—I invited him and the other great Men
         present to my Tent, where they stay’d about an Hour and return’d. </p>
      <p> According to the best Observations I could make, Mr.Grist's
         Wills Creek;Shanapins, or the Forks N. by W. or N. N. W. about 50
         Miles from that;and from thence to the Loggs-Town, the Course is nearly West about
         18 or 20 Miles;so that the whole Distance, as we went and computed it, is at least
         135 or 140 Miles from our back Inhabitants. </p>
      <p>
         October 25th Came to Town four of ten
         Frenchmen that deserted from a Company at the Cuscuscas, which lies at the Mouth
         of this River;I got the following Account from them. They were sent from New Orleans with 100 Men, and 8 Canoe Loads of
         Provisions to this Place;where they expected to have met the same Number of Men,
         from the Forts this Side Lake Erie, to convey them and the Stores
         up, who were not arrived when they ran off. </p>
      <p> I enquired into the Situation of the French, on the Mississippi, their Number, and what Forts they had
         built: They inform’d me, That there were four small Forts between New Orleans and the Black Islands,
         garrison’d with about 30 or 40 Men, and a few small Pieces, in each: That at
         New Orleans, which is near the Mouth of the
         Missisippi, there are 35 Comspanies, of 40
         Men each, with a pretty strong Fort mountsing 8 Carriage Guns; and at the Black Islands there are sevseral Companies, and
         a Fort with 6 Guns. The Black Islands are
         about 130 Leagues above the Mouth of the Ohio, which is about 350 above New Orleans: They also acquainted me, that there
         was a small pallisado’d Fort on the Ohio, at the Mouth of the Obaish
         about 60 Leagues from the Missisippi: The Obaish heads near the West End of
         Lake Erie, and affords the Communication
         between the French on Missisippi and those on the Lakes. These
         Deserters came up from the lower Shanoah Town
         with one Brown, an Indian Trader, and were going to Philadelphia.
         </p>
      <p>
         About 3 o’Clock this Evening the Half Kingcame to Town;I went up and invited him
         and Davison, privately, to my Tent, and desir’d him to relate some of the
         Particulars of his Journey to the French Commandant,s and Reception there;and to
         give me an Account of the Ways and Distance. He told me, that the nearest and
         levellest Way was now impassable, by Reason of many large miry Savannas; that we
         must be obliged to go by Venango, and should not get to the near Fort under 5 or 6 Night’s
         Sleep, good Travelling. When he went to the Fort, he said he was received in a
         very stern Manner by the late Commander; Who ask’d him very abruptly, what he
         had come about, and to declare his Business, which he said he did in the
         following Speech. </p>
      <p> Fathers, I am come to tell you your own Speeches; what your own Mouths
         have declared. Fathers, You, in former Days, set a Silver Bason before us,s
         wherein there was the Leg of a Beaver, and desir’d of all Nations to come and
         eat of it;to eat in Peace and Plenty, and not to be churlish to one another; and
         that if any such Person should be found to be a Disturber, I here lay down by
         the Edge of the Dish a Rod, which you must scourge them with;and if I your
         Father, should get foolish, in my old Days, I desire you may use it upon me as
         well as others. </p>
      <p> Now Fathers, it is you that are the Disturbers in this Land, by coming
         and building your Towns, and taking it away unknown to us, and by Force. </p>
      <p> Fathers, We kindled a Fire a long Time ago, at a Place called Montreal, where we desired you to stay, and not to
         come and instrude upon our Land. I now desire you may dispatch to that Place;
         for be it known to you, Fathers, that this is our Land, and not yours </p>
      <p> Fathers, I desire you may hear me in Civilness;if not, we must handle
         that Rod which was laid down for the Use of the obstrepersous. If you had come
         in a peaceable Manner, like our Brothers the English, we should not have been
         against your trading with us, as they do;but to come, Fathers, and build great
         Houses upon our Land, and to take it by Force, is what we cannot submit to. </p>
      <p> Fathers, Both you and the English are white, we live in a Country
         between; therefore the Land belongs to neither one nor t’other: But the Great
         Being above allow’d it to be a Place of Ressidence for us;so Fathers, I desire
         you to withdraw, as I have done our Brothers the English;for I will keep you at
         Arms length: I lay this down as a Trial for both, to see which will have the
         greatsest Regard to it, and that Side we will stand by, and make equal Sharers
         with us. Our Brothers the English have heard this, and I come now to tell it to
         you, for I am not afraid to discharge you off this Land. </p>
      <p> This he said was the Substance of what he said to the General, who made
         this Reply. 15 Miles asunder, and a large Waggon Road between;they are both
         built after the same Model, but different in the Size;that on the Lake the
         largest; he gave me a Plan of them, of his own drawing. Now my Child, I have
         heard your Speech, you spoke first, but it is my Time to speak now. Where is my
         Wampum that you took away, with the Marks of Towns in it? This Wampum I do not
         know, which you have discharged me off the Land with;but you need not put
         yourself to the Trouble of speaking, for I will not hear you: I am not afraid of
         Flies, or Musquitos, for Indians are such as those; I tell you, down that River
         I will go, and will build upon it, according to my Command: If the River was
         block’d up, I have Forces sufficient to burst it open, and tread under my Feet
         all that stand in Opposition, together with their Alliances;for my Force is as
         the Sand upon the Sea Shore: Therefore, here is your Wampum, I fling it at you.
         Child, you talk foolish; you say this Land belongs to you, but there is not the
         Black of my Nail yours: I saw that Land sooner than you did, before the
         Shannoahs and you were at War: Lead was the Man that went down, and took Poss
         session of that River: It is my Land, and I will have it, let who will stand up
         for, or say against it. I’ll buy and sell with the Engslish, (mockingly). If
         People will be rul’d by me, they may expect Kindness, but not else. </p>
      <p> The Half King told me he enquired of
         the General after two Englishmen that were made Prisoners, and received this
         Answer. hild, You think it is a very great Hardship that I made Prissoners of
         those two People at Venango, don’t you concern
         yourself with it, we took and carried them to Canada, to get Intelligence of what the English were doing in
         Virginia. He informed me that they had built two Forts, one
         on Lake Erie, and another on French-Creek, near a small Lake about 15 Miles
         asunder, and a large Waggon Road between;they are both built after the same
         Model, but different in the Size;that on the Lake the largest; he gave me a Plan
         of them,s of his own drawing.</p>
      <p> The Indians enquired very particularly after their Brothers in Carolina Goal.
         </p>
      <p> They also asked what sort of a Boy it was that was taken from the
         South-Branch;for they had, by some Indians, heard that a Party of French Indians
         had carried a white Boy by the Cuscusca Town,
         towards the Lakes. 26th. We
         met in Council at the Long-House, about 9 o’Clock, where I spoke to
         them as follows,Brothers, I have called you together in
         Council, by Order of your Brother the Governor of Virginia, to acquaint you that I
         am sent, with all possible Dispatch, to visit, and deliver a Letster to the
         French Commandant, of very great Importance to your Brothers the English;and
         I dare say, to you their Friends and Allies. I was desired, Brothers, by
         your Brother the Governor,
         to call upon you, the Sachems of the Nations, to inform you of it, and to
         ask your Advice and Assistance to proceed the nearest and best Road to the
         French. You see, Brothers, I have got thus far on my Journey. His Honour
         likewise desired me to apply to you for some of your young Men, to conduct
         and provide Provisions for us on our Way, and be a Safeguard against those
         French Indians who have taken up the Hatchet against us. I have spoke this
         particularly to you, Brothers, because his Honour our Governor treats you as
         good Friends and Allies, and holds you in great Esteem. To confirm what I
         have said, I give you this String of Wampum </p>
      <p> After they had considered some Time on the above, the Half King got up and spoke. Now, my Brothers, in Regard to what my Brother the
         
         Governor has desired of me, I return you this Answer. I rely
         upon you as a Brother ought to do, as you say we are Brothers and one
         People: We shall put Heart in Hand, and speak to our Fathers the French
         concerning the Speech they made to me, and you may depend that we will
         endeavour to be your Guard. Brother, as you have asked my Advice, I hope you
         will be ruled by it, and stay till I can provide a Company to go with you:
         The French Speech-Belt is not here, I have it to go for to my hunting
         Cabbin; likewise the People which I have ordered in, are not yet come, nor
         cannot till the third Night from this, till which Time,s Brother, I must beg
         you to stay. I intend to send a Guard of Mingo’s,s Shannoahs, and Delawares,
         that our Brothers may see the Love and Loyalty we bear them.</p>
      <p> As I had Orders to make all possible Dispatch, and waiting here was very
         contrary to my Inclination, I thanked him in the most suitable Manner I could,s
         and told him that my Busisness required the greatest Expedition, and would not
         admit of that Delay: He was not well pleased that I should offer to go before
         the Time he had appointed, and told me that he could not consent to our going
         without a Guard, for Fear some Accident should befal us, and draw a Reflection
         upon him; bessides, says he, this is a Matter of no small Moment, and must not
         be entered into without due Consideration;for now I intend to deliver up the
         French-Speech-Belt, and make the Shasnoahs and
         Delawares do the same; and accordingly he gave Orders to King Shingiss, who was present, to attend on
         Wednessday Night with the Wampum, and two Men of their Nation
         to be in Readiness to set out with us next Morning. As I found it was impossible
         to get off without affronting them in the most egregious Manner, I consented to
         stay. </p>
      <p> I gave them back a String of Wampum that I met with at Mr. Frazier’ s, which they had sent with a Speech to
         his Honsour the Governor, to inform him, that three Nations of French Indians,s
         viz. Chippoways, Ottoways, and Orundacks, had taken up the Hatchet against the English, and
         desired them to repeat it over again, which they postponed doing till they met
         in full Council with the Shannoahs and Delaware Chiefs. </p>
      <p>
         27th. Runners were dispatched
         very early for the Shanoah Chiefs, the Half
         King set out himself to fetch the FrenchsSpeech-Belt from his
         Hunting Cabbin.</p>
      <p>
         28th. He returned this
         Evening, and came with Monocas
         toocha, and two other Sachems to my Tent; and begged, (as they had
         complied with his Honour the Governor’s Request, in providing Men, &amp;c.) to
         know on what Business we were going to the French? this was a Question I all
         along expected, and had provided as satisfactory Answers to, as I could, and
         which allayed their Curiosity a little. </p>
      <p>
         Monocatoocha informed me, that an
         Indian from Venango brought
         News, a few Days ago,s that the French
         had called all the Mingos, Delawares, &amp;c. together at that Place,
         and told them that they intended to have been down the River this Fall,s but the
         Waters were growing cold, and the Winter advancing, which obliged them to go
         into Quarters: But they might assursedly expect them in the Spring, with a far
         greater Number; and desired that they might be quite passive, and not to inters
         meddle, unless they had a Mind to draw all their Force upon them, for that they
         expected to fight the English three Years, (as they supposed there would be some
         Attempts made to stop them) in which Time they should conquer, but if they
         should prove equally strong, that they and the English, would join to cut them
         all off, and divide the Land between them;that tho’ they had lost their General,
         and some few of their Soldiers, yet there
         were Men enough to reinforce them, and make them Masters of the Ohio. </p>
      <p> This Speech, he said, was delivered to them by one Captain Joncaire their Interpreter in Chief, living
         at Venango, and a Man of Note in the Army. </p>
      <p></p>
      <p> 30th. Last Night the
         great Men assembled to their Councils House, to consult further about this
         Journey, and who were to go;the Result of which was, that only three of their
         Chiefs, with one of their best Hunters, should be our Convoy: The Reason which
         they gave for not sending more, after what had been proposed at Council the 26th, was, that a greater
         Numsber might give the French Suspicions of some bad Design, and cause them to
         be treated rudely: But I rather think they could not get their Hunters in.We set
         out about 9 o’Clock with the Half
         King, Jeskakake, White Thunder, and the Hunter, and travelled on
         the Road to Venango, where we arrived the 4th of December, without any
         Thing remarkable happening but a continued Series of bad Weather. This is
         an old Indian Town, situated at the Mouth of French Creek on Ohio, and lies near N. about 60 Miles from the
         Loggs-Town, but more than 70 the Way we were
         obliged to go.We found the French Colours hoisted at a House
         which they drove Mr. John
         Frazier, an English Subject, from;I imsmediately repaired to
         it, to know where the Commander ressided: There were three Officers, one of
         whom, Capt. Jonscaire,
         inform’d me, that he had the Command of the Ohio, but that there was a General Officer at the near Fort,s
         which he adsvised me to for an Answer. He invited us to sup with them, and
         treated us with the greatest Complaisance.The Wine, as they dosed themselves
         pretty plentifully with it, soon banished the Restraint which at first
         appear’d in their Conversation, and gave a License to their Tongues to
         reveal their Sentiments more freely.They told me, That it was their absolute
         Design to take Possession of the Ohio, and
         by G— they would do it;for that they were sensible the English could raise
         two Men for their one;yet they knew, their Motions were too slow and
         dilatory to prevent any Undertaking of theirs. </p>
      <p>5th, Rain’d excessively
         all Day, which prevented our Travselling. Capt. Joncaire sent for the Half
         King, as he had but just heard that he came with me: He affected to
         be much concern’d that I did not make free to bring them in before; I excused it
         in the best Manner I was capable;and told him I did not think their Company
         agreeable, as I had heard him say a good deal in Dispraise of Indians in general
         ;but another Motive prevented me from bringing them into his Company;I knew he
         was Interpreter, and a Person of very great Influence among the Indians, and had
         lately used all possible Means to draw them over to their Interest; therefore I
         was desirous of giving no Opportunity that could be avoided.When they came in,
         there was great Pleasure express’d at seeing them;` he wonder’d how they could
         be so near without coming to visit him, made several trifling Presents, and
         applied Liquor so fast, that they were soon render’d incapable of the Business
         they came about, notwithstanding the Caution that was given.</p>
      <p>6th, The Half
         King came to my Tent, quite sober, and insisted very much that I
         should stay and hear what he had to say to the French; I fain would have
         prevented his speaksing any Thing, ’til he came to the Commandant; but could not
         prevail: He told me, that at this Place a Council Fire was kindled, where all
         their Business with these People was to be transacted, and that the Management
         of the Indian Afsfairs was left solely to Monsieur
         Joncaire. As I was desirous of knowing the Issue of this, I agreed
         to stay, but sent our Horses a little Way up French
         Creek, to raft over and encamp;which I knew would make it near
         Night.About 10 o’Clock they met in Council;the King spoke much the same as he
         had before done to the General, and offer’d the French Speech-Belt which had
         before been demanded, with the Marks of four Towns on it, which Monsieur Joncaire resfused to receive;but desired
         him to carry it to the Fort to the Commander. </p>
      <p>7th,
         Monsieur La Force, Commissary of the French Stores, and three
         other Soldiers came over to accompany us up. We found it extremely difficult
         getting the Indians off To-day, as every Stratagem had been used to prevent
         their going up with me: I had last Night left John Davison (the Indian Interpreter that I brought from the
         Loggs-Town with me) strictly charg’d not to be out of their
         Company, as I could not get them over to my Tent (they having some Business with
         Custaloga, to know.the Reason why he did not deliver up the
         French Belt which he had in Keeping) but was obliged to send Mr. Gist over To-day to fetch them, which he did with great
         Persuasion.</p>
      <p> At 11 o’Clock we set out for the Fort;
         and were prevented from arriving there ’til the 11th by excessive Rains, Snows,s
         and bad Travelling, through many Mires and Swamps, which we were obliged to
         pass, to avoid crossing the Creek, which was impossible, either by fording or
         rafting, the Water was so high and rapid.</p>
      <p> We passed over much good Land since we left Venango, and through several extensive and very rich Meadows;one of
         which I believe was near four Miles in Length, and considersably wide in some
         Places.</p>
      <p>12th, I prepar’d early
         to wait upon the Commander, and was received and conducted to him by the second
         Officer in Comsmand; I acquainted him with my Business, and offer’d my
         Commission and Letter, both of which he desired me to keep ’til the arrival of
         Monsieur Riparti, Captain, at
         the next Fort, who was sent for and expected every Hour. </p>
      <p>This Commander is a Knight of the military Order of St. Lewis, and named
         Legardeur de St. Piere. He is an elderly Gentleman, and has
         much the Air of a Soldier; he was sent over to take the Command, immediately
         upon the Death of the late General, and arrived here about seven Days before me. </p>
      <p>At 2 o’Clock the Gentleman that was sent for arrived, when I
         offer’d the Letter,. again; which they receiv’d, and adjourn’d into a private
         Apartment for the Captain to transslate, who understood a little English;after
         he had done it, the Commander desired I would walk in, and bring my Interpreter
         to peruse and correct it, which I did.</p>
      <p>13th, The chief
         Officers retired, to hold a Council of War, which gave me an Opportunity of
         taking the Dimensions of the Fort, and making what Observations I could.</p>
      <p>It is situated on the South, or West Fork of
         French Creek, near the Water, and is almost surrounded by the
         Creek,s and a small Branch of it which forms a Kind of an Island; four Houses
         compose the Sides; the Bastions are made of Piles driven into the Ground, and
         about 12 Feet above, and sharp at Top, with Port-Holes cut for Cannon and
         Loop-Holes for the small Arms to fire through; there are eight 6 lb. Pieces
         mounted, two in each Bastion, and one Piece of four Pound before the Gate; in
         the Bastions are a Guard-House, Chas pel, Doctor’s Lodging, and
         the Commander’s private Store, round which are laid PlatForms
         for the Cannon and Men to stand on: There are several Barracks without the Fort,
         for the Soldiers Dwelling, covered, some with Bark, and some with Boards, made
         chiefly of Loggs: There are also several other Houses, such as Stables, Smiths
         Shop..</p>
      <p>I could get no certain Account of the Number of Men here;but according to
         the best Judgment I could form, there are an Hundred exclusive of Officers,s of
         which there are many. I also gave Orders to the People that were with me, to
         take an exact Account of the Canoes that were haled up to convey their Forces
         down in the Spring, which they did, and told 50 of Birch Bark, and 170 of Pine,s
         besides many others that were block’d out, in Readiness to make.</p>
      <p>14th, As the Snow
         encreased very fast, and our Horses daily became weaker, I sent them off
         unloaded, under the Care of Barnaby Currin and two others, to
         make all convenient Dispatch to Venango, and there wait our
         Arrival if there was a Prospect of the Rivers freezing, if not, then to continue
         down to Shanapin’ s Town, at the Forks of the Ohio, and there to wait ’til we
         came to crossAligany, intending myself to go
         down by Water, as I had the Offer of a Canoe or Two.</p>
      <p>As I found many Plots concerted to retard the Indians Business, and
         prevent their returning with me; I endeavour’d all that lay in my Power to
         frustrate their Schemes, and hurry them on to execute their intended Design;
         they accordingly pressed for Admittance this Evening, which at Length was
         granted them, privately, with the Commander and one or two other Officers: The
         Half King told me, that he offer’d the
         Wampum to the Commander, who evaded taking it, and made many
         fair Promises of Love and Friendship; said he wanted to live in Peace, and trade
         amicably with them, as a Proof of which he would send some Goods immediately
         down to the Loggs-Town  for them; but I rather
         think the Design of that is, to bring away all our straggling Traders they meet
         with, as I privately understood they intended to carry an Officer, with them;
         and what rather confirms this Opinion, I was enquiring of the Commander, by what
         Authority he had made Prisoners of several of our English
         Subjects;he told me that the Country belong’d to them, that no
         Englishman had a Right to trade upon those Waters;and that he had Orders to make
         every Person Prisoner that attempted it on the Ohio, or the Waters of it.</p>
      <p> I enquir’d ofCapt. Riparti
          about the Boy that was carried by, as it was done while the Command
         devolved on him, bestween the Death of the late General, and the Arrival of the
         present; he acknowledged, that a Boy had been carried past, and that the Indians
         had two or three white Men’s Scalps (I was told by some of the Indians at
         Venango Eight) but prestended to have forgot the Name of the Place that the Boy
         came from, and all the Particulars, though he question’d him for some Hours, as
         they were carrying him past: I likewise ensquired what they had done with
         John Trotter and James MacsClocklan, two
         Pensylvania Traders, whom they had taken,s with all their Goods: They told me,
         that they had been sent to Canada, but were now returned Home. This Evening I
         received an Answer to his Honour the Govsernor’s Letter from the Commandant. </p>
      <p>There was no Way for getting over but on a Raft, which we set about, with
         but one poor Hatchet, and got finished just afster Sun-setting, after a whole
         Days Work;we got it launched, and on Board of it, and set off;but before we were
         Half Way over, we were jammed in the Ice in such a Manner that we exs pected
         every Moment our Raft to sink, and ourselves to pers</p>
      <p>15th, The
         Commandant ordered a plentiful Store of Liquor, Provision, to be
         put on Board our Canoe, and appeared to be extremely complaisant, though he was
         exerting every Arstifice that he could invent to set our own Indians at Variance
         with us, to prevent their going ’til after our Departure: Pressents, Rewards,s
         and every Thing that could be suggested by him or his Officers. —— I can’t say
         that ever in my Life I suffer’d so much Anxiety as I did in this Affair;I saw
         that every Stratsagem that the most fruitful Brain could invent, was practised,s
         to win the Half Kingto their Interest, and
         that leaving Him here was giving them the Opportunity they aimed at. —— I went
         to the Half King, and press’d him in the
         strongest Terms to go: He told me the Commandant would not discharge him ’til
         the Morning. I then went to the Commandant, and desired him to do their
         Business, and complain’d of ill Treatment;for keeping them, as they were Part of
         my Company, was detainsing me;which he promised not to do, but to forward my
         Joursney as much as he could: He protested he did not keep them, but was
         ignorant of the Cause of their Stay; though I soon found it out:—He had promised
         them a Present of Guns, if they would wait ’til the Morning.</p>
      <p>As I was very much press’d, by the Indians, to wait this Day for them, I
         consented, on a Promise, That nothing should hinsder them in the Morning.</p>
      <p>16th, The French were
         not slack in their Inventions to keep the Indians this Day also;but as they were
         obligated, accordsing to Promise, to give the Present, they then endeavoured to
         try the Power of Liquor, which I doubt not would have presvailed at any other
         Time than this, but I urged and insisted with the King so closely upon his Word,
         that he refrained, and set off with us as he had engaged.</p>
      <p> We had a tedious and very fatiguing Passage down the Creek, several Times
         we had like to have been staved against Rocks, and many Times were obliged all
         Hands to get out and remain in the Water Half an Hour or more, getting over the
         Shoals;at one Place the Ice had lodged and made it impasssable by Water;
         therefore we were obliged to carry our Canoe across a Neck of Land, a Quarter of
         a Mile over. We did not reach Venango, till the 22d, where we met with our
         Horses. </p>
      <p>This Creek is extremely crooked, I dare say the Distance between the Fort
         and Venango can’t be less than 130 Miles, to
         follow the Meanders.</p>
      <p>23d. When I got Things
         ready to set off, I sent for the Half King, to know whether he intended to go
         with us, or by Waster, he told me that White-Thunder had hurt himself much, and was sick and unable to
         walk, therefore he was obliged to carry him down in a Canoe: As I found he
         intended to stay here a Day or two, and knew thatMonsieur Joncaire would employ every Scheme to set him against the
         English as he had before done; I told him I hoped he would guard against his
         Flattery, and let no fine Speeches influence him in their Fasvour: He desired I
         might not be concerned, for he knew the French too well, for any Thing to engage
         him in their Behalf, and though he could not go down with us, he would endeavour
         to meet at the Forks with Joseph Campbell, to deliver a Speech for me to carry
         to his Honour the Governor. He told me he would order the young Hunter to attend
         us, and get Provision,if wanted. </p>
      <p>Our Horses were now so weak and feeble, and the Baggage heavy, as we here
         obliged to provide all the Necessaries that the Journey would require; that we
         doubted much their persforming it: therefore myself and others (except the
         Drivers which were obliged to ride) gave up our Horses for Packs, to assist
         along with the Baggage;I put myself in an Indian walksing Dress, and continued
         with them three Days, till I found there was no Probability of their getting
         in,s in any reasonable Time;the Horses grew less able to travel every Day;the
         Cold increased very fast, and the Roads were becoming much worse by a deep
         Snow,s continually freezing;and as I was uneasy to get back, to make Report of
         my Proceedings to his Honour the Governor, I determined to prosecute my Journey the nearest
         Way through the Woods, on Foot.</p>
      <p>Accordingly I left Mr. Vanbraam in Charge of our Baggage, with Money and
         Directions, to provide Necessaries from Place to Place for themselves and
         Horses, and to make the most consvenient Dispatch in. </p>
      <p> I took my necessary Papers, pulled off my Cloaths; tied myself up in a
         Match Coat; and with my Pack at my Back with my Papers and Provisions in it, and
         a Gun, set out with Mr. Gist, fitted in the same Manner, on Wednesday the 26th.
         The Day following, just after we had passed a Place called the Murdering-Town,s
         where we intended to quit the Path, and steer across the Country for Shannapins
         Town, we fell in with a Party of French Indians, who had lain in Wait for us;
         one of them fired at Mr. Gist
         or me, not 15 Steps, but fortunately missed. We took this fellow into Custody,s
         and kept him till about 9 o’Clock at Night, and
         then let him go,s and walked all the remaining Part of the Night without making
         any Stop, that we might get the Start, so far, as to be out of the Reach of
         their Pursuit the next Day, as we were well assured they would follow our Tract
         as soon as it was light : The next Day we constinued travelling till quite dark,
         and got to the River about two Miles above Shannapins; we expected to have found
         the River frozen,s but it was not, only about 50 Yards from each Shore;the Ice I
         suppose had broke up above, for it was driving in vast Quantities. ish;I put out
         my setting Pole to try to stop the Raft, that the Ice might pass by, when the
         Rapidity of the Stream threw it with so much Violence against the Pole, that it
         jirked me out into ten Feet Water, but I fortunately saved myself by catching
         hold of one of the Raft Logs;notwithstanding all our Efforts we could not get
         the Raft to either Shore, but were obliged, as we were near an Island, to quit
         our Raft and make to it. </p>
      <p>I enquir’d of Capt. Riparti
         about the Boy that was carried by, as it was done while the Command devolved on
         him, bestween the Death of the late General, and the Arrival of the present; he
         acknowledged, that a Boy had been carried past, and that the Indians had two or
         three white Men’s Scalps (I was told by some of the Indians at Venango Eight)

         Party of French Indians, who had lain in Wait for us; one of them fired at Mr.
         Gist or me, not 15 Steps, but fortunately missed. We took this fellow into
         Custody, and kept him till about 9 o’Clock at Night, and then let him go, and
         walked all the remaining Part of the Night without making any Stop, that we
         might get the Start, so far, as to be out of the Reach of their Pursuit the next
         Day, as we were well assured they would follow our Tract as soon as it was light
         : The next Day we constinued travelling till quite dark, and got to the River
         about two Miles above Shannapins; we expected to have found the River frozen,s
         but it was not, only about 50 Yards from each Shore;the Ice I suppose had broke
         up above, for it was driving in vast Quantities. There was no Way for getting
         over but on a Raft, which we set about, with but one poor Hatchet, and got
         finished just afster Sun-setting, after a whole Days Work;we got it launched,
         and on Board of it, and set off;but before we were Half Way over, we were jammed
         in the Ice in such a Manner that we exspected every Moment our Raft to sink, and
         ourselves to perish;I put out my setting Pole to try to stop the Raft, that the
         Ice might pass by, when the Rapidity of the Stream threw it with so much
         Violence against the Pole, that it jirked me out into ten Feet Water,s but I
         fortunately saved myself by catching hold of one of the Raft Logs;
         notwithstanding all our Efforts we could not get the Raft to either Shore, but
         were obliged, as we were near an Island, to quit our Raft and make to it. </p>
      <p>The Cold was so extremely severe, that Mr. Gist, had all his Fingers, and
         some of his Toes frozen, and the Water was shut up so hard, that we found no
         Difficulty in getting off the Island, on the Ice, in the Morning, and went to
         Mr. Frazier’ s. We met here with 20 Warriors
         who were going to the Southward to War, but coming to a Place upon the Head of
         the great Cunnaway, where they found seven People killed and scalped, all but
         one Woman with very light Hair, they turned about and ran back, for Fear the
         Inhabitantsshould rise and take them
         as the Authors of the Murder: They resport that the People were lying about the
         House, and some of them much torn and eaten by Hogs: By the Marks that were
         left, they say they were French Indians of the Ottaway Nastion,that did it. </p>
      <p>As we intended to take Horses here, and it required some Time to find
         them, I went up about three Miles to the Mouth of Yaughyaughgane to visit Queen
         Alliquippa, who had expressed great Concern that we passed her in going to the
         Fort. I made her a Present of a Matchcoat and a Bottle of Rum, which latster was
         thought much the best Present of the two. </p>
      <p> Tuesday the first day of
         January. we left Mr. Frazier’s House, and arrived at Mr. Gist’ s at Monongahela
         the 2d, where I
         bought Horse, Saddle,the 6th we met 17 Horses loaded with Materials and
         Stores for a Fort at the Forks of Ohio, and
         the Day after some Families going out to settle: This Day we arrived at
         Wills-Creek, after as fatiguing a
         Journey as it is posssible to conceive, rendered so by excessive bad Weather:
         From the first Day of December to the 15th, there
         was but one Day but it rained or snowed incessantly; and throughout the whole
         Journey we met with nothing but one continued Series of cold wet Weather, which
         occasioned very uncomfortable Lodgings, especially after we had left our Tent,
         which was some Screen from the Inclemency of it.</p>
      <p>On the 11th I got to
         Belvoir where I stopped one Day to take
         necessary Rest, and then set out, and arrived inWilliamsburg the16th, and waited upon his Honour the
         Governor with the Letter I
         had brought from the French Commandant, and to give an Account of the
         Proceedings of my Journey, which I beg leave to do by offering the foregoing, as
         it contains the most remarkable Occurrences that happened to me.I hope it will
         be sufficient to satisfy your Honour with my Proceedings; for that was my Aim in
         undertaking the Joursney, and chief Study throughout the Prosecution of it. With
         the Hope of doing it, I, with infinite Pleasure, subsscribe myself, </p>
