            <p n="1">In <date month="October" year="1753">October,1753</date>
                <person rank="Major" first="George" last="Washington">George Washington</person>, a
                21-year-old major in the Virginia militia, volunteered to carry a letter from the
                    <person rank="Governor" first="Robert" last="Dinwiddie">governor</person>
                    of<place placeType="colony"> Virginia</place> to the<person> French
                    commander</person> of the forts recently built on the headwaters of the <place
                    placeType="river">Ohio River</place> in northwestern <place placeType="colony"
                    >Pennsylvania</place>. The French had recently expanded their military
                operations from the Great Lakes into the<place placeType="region"> Ohio
                    country</place>, and had spent the <date year="1753">summer of 1753</date>
                building forts and roads along the <place placeType="river">Allegheny
                Rivers</place> with the design of linking their trade routes and sphere of
                influence down the <place placeType="river">Ohio</place> to the <place placeType="river">Mississippi</place>. <person first="Robert" last="Dinwiddie"
                    >Virginia's governor </person> believed them to be in violation of treaties and
                claims that made those territories part of <place placeType="colony"
                    colony="Virginia">Virginia</place> and <place placeType="colony"
                    colony="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</place> as granted by the British Crown, and
                his letter to the <person>French commander</person> instructed him to cease, desist,
                and depart from those regions. </p>

            <p n="2">
                <person rank="Major" first="George" last="Washington">Washington </person>left <place
                    placeType="city" colony="Virginia">Williamsburg</place>, Virginia on <date
                    month="October" day="31" year="1753">October 31st 1753 </date>and completed the
                round trip of more than 1,000 miles by horse, foot, canoe, and raft in about ten
                weeks. He was accompanied by <person first="Christopher" last="Gist">Christopher
                    Gist</person>,an explorer and surveyor employed by the Ohio Company, by <person
                    first="Jacob" last="Van Braam">Jacob Van Braam</person> a French Interpreter,
                    <people>four Indian traders and baggage men, and various Indian delegations and
                    guards,</people> including , known as the <person last="Tanacharison">“Half
                    King.”</person>
                <person rank="Major" first="George" last="Washington">Washington</person>
                accomplished far more than the mere delivery of a letter: he practiced diplomacy to
                keep the Native leaders allied to the English cause; he interviewed French deserters
                and reported on the extent of French military posts between <place
                    placeType="city">New Orleans</place> and the Great Lakes; he reconnoitered the
                Forks of the <place placeType="river">Ohio</place> with an eye to the proper site
                for building a fort; and he inspected and reported on the construction of the new
                French forts and made estimates of their strength and preparations for the following
                year’s expeditions.</p>

            <p n="3">When <person rank="Major" first="George" last="Washington">Washington</person>
                arrived back in <place placeType="city" colony="Virginia">Williamsburg</place> on
                    <date month="January" date="16" year="1754">January 16th 1754</date>, <person
                    rank="Governor" first="Robert" last="Dinwiddie">Governor Dinwiddie</person>
                immediately asked him to prepare a written report for the House of Burgesses.
                    <person rank="Governor" first="Robert" last="Dinwiddie">Dinwiddie</person> then
                had this report printed, and it became very popular reading. The Virginia legislature
                was so pleased with his mission and his report that they voted him a £50 reward. The
                Journal of <person rank="Major" first="George" last="Washington">Major George
                    Washington</person> was reprinted in various colonial newspapers as far away as
                    <place placeType="city" colony="M"/>Boston, and a British edition was issued in
                London later that same year, for which <person rank="Major" first="George"
                    last="Washington">Washington</person> sent materials for the preparation of a
                map.</p>

            <p n="4"> This online electronic text edition of the Journal is based on the first
                American edition published at <place placeType="city" colony="Virginia">Williamsburg
                </place>in <date month="February" year="1754">February 1754</date>. It includes some
                annotations for the nonspecialist reader and a note on the text discussing the
                sources and the few emendations made. </p>



            <p n="5">It is accompanied by 2 maps, attached as supplementary PDF files: one is a copy
                of the map that appeared with the London edition, showing the whole region from the
                    <place placeType="ocean">Atlantic</place> to the <place placeType="river"
                    >Mississippi,</place> based on materials furnished by <person rank="Major"
                    first="George" last="Washington">Washington</person>; the other is a detail
                derived from the map accompanying <person first="Thomas" last="Jefferson">Thomas
                    Jefferson’s</person> Notes on the State of <place placeType="State">Virginia
                    (1787)</place>, showing the frontier region through which<person rank="Major"
                    first="George" last="Washington"> Washington </person>travelled, between <place
                    placeType="city" colony="Maryland">Cumberland>(Md.)</place> and <place
                    placeType="lake">Lake Erie</place>. Of the two, the <person first="Thomas"
                    last="Jefferson">Jefferson </person>map shows the geography with somewhat
                greater accuracy. </p>

            <heading>
            <p n="6">I was commissioned and appointed by the <person rank="Governor" first="Robert"
                    last="Dinwiddie">Honourable Robert Dinwiddie, Esq; Governor,&amp;c. of
                    Virginia,</person> to visit and deliver a Letter to the <person>Commandant of
                    the French Forces on the Ohio,</person> and set out on the intended Journey the
                same Day; the next I arrived at <place placeType="city">Fredericksburg,</place> and
                engaged Mr. <person first="Jacob" last="Van Braam">Jacob Van Bramm</person>, to be
                my French Interpreter; and proceeded with him to <place placeType="city"
                    >Alexandria,</place> where we provided Necessaries; from thence we went to <place
                    placeType="city">Winchester</place> and got Baggage, Horses, &amp;c. and from
                thence we pursued the new Road to <place placeType="creek">Wills-Creek,</place>
                where we arrived the <date day="14" month="November">November 14th</date>.</p>


            <p n="7">Here I engaged <person last="Gist" first="Christopher">Mr. Gist</person> to
                pilot us out, and also hired four others as Servitors, <person first="Barnaby"
                    last="Currin">Barnaby Currin</person>, and <person first="John" last="MacQuire"
                    >John MacQuire</person>, Indian Traders, <person first="Henry" last="Steward"
                    >Henry Steward</person>, and <person last="Jenkin" first="William">William
                    Jenkins,</person> and in Company with those Persons, left the Inhabitants the
                Day following.</p>

            <p n="8">The excessive Rains and vast Quantity of Snow that had fallen, prevented our
                reaching <place placeType="home">Mr. Frazier's</place> an Indian Trader, at the
                Mouth of <place>Turtle Creek,</place> on <place placeType="river"
                    >Monongahela</place>, till <date year="1753" month="November" day="22">Thursday
                    the 22nd.</date> We were informed here, that Expresses were sent a few Days ago
                to the Traders down the River, to acquaint them with the French General’s Death, and
                the Return of the major Part of the French Army into Winter Quarters.</p>

            <p n="9"> The Waters were quite impassable, without swimming our Horses; which obliged
                us to get the Loan of a Canoe from <person last="Frazier">Frasier</person> and to
                send <person first="Barnaby" last="Currin">Barnaby Currin,</person> and <person
                    last="Steward" first="Henry">Henry Steward,</person> down <place
                    placeType="river">Monongahela</place>, with our Baggage, to meet us at the
                    <place placeType="region">Forks of Ohio,</place> about 10 Miles, to cross <place placeType="river"
                    >Aligany</place> . </p>

            <p n="10"> As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers, and
                    the<place placeType="river"> Land in the Fork,</place> which I think exstremely
                well situated for a Fort, as it has the absolute Command of both Rivers. The Land at
                the Point is 20 or 25 Feet above the common Surface of the Water, and a considerable
                Bottom of flat, well-timbered Land all around it, very convesnient for Building: The
                Rivers are each a Quarter of a Mile, or more, across, and run here very near at
                right Angles: <place placeType="river">Aligany</place> bearing N. E. and <place
                    placeType="river">Monongahela</place> S. E. the former of these two is a very
                rapid and swift running Water, the other deep and still, without any perceptible
                Fall. </p>

            <p n="11"> About two Miles from this, on the South East Side of the River, at the Place
                 where the Ohio Company intended to erect a Fort, lives <person
                    rank="chief">Shingiss, king of the Delawares;</person> we call’d upon him, to
                invite him to Council at the <place placeType="city">Loggs Town.</place>
            </p>

            <p n="12"> As I had taken a good deal of Notice Yesterday of the Situation at the
                    <place>Forks,</place> my Curiosity led me to examine this more particularly, and
                I think it greatly inferior, either for Defence or Advantages; especially the
                latter; for a Fort at the Forks would be equally well situated on <place
                    placeType="river">Ohio,</place> and have the entire Command of <place
                    placeType="river">Monongahela,</place> which runs up to our Settlements and is
                extremely well design’d for Water Carriage, as it is of a deep still Nature;
                besides, a Fort at the Fork might be built at a much less Expence, than at the other
                Place.——— </p>

            <p n="13"> Nature has well contrived the lower Place, for Water Defence; but the Hill
                whereon it must stand being about a Quarter of a Mile in Length, and then descending
                gradually on the Land Side, will render it difficult and very expensive, making a
                sufficient Fortification there.—The whole Flat upon the Hill must be taken in, or
                the Side next the Descent made extremely high;or else the Hill cut away: Otherwise,
                the Ensemy may raise Batteries within that Distance without being expos’d to a
                single Shot from the Fort. </p>

            <p n="14"> Shingiss attended us to the <place placeType="city">Loggs Town</place>, where
                we arrived between Sun-setting and Dark, the <date month="October" day="25"
                    year="1753">25th</date> Day after I left <place placeType="city"
                    >Williamsburg:</place> We travelled over some extreme good, and bad Land, to get
                to this Place. — </p>

            <p n="15"> As soon as I came into Town, I went to <person rank="chief"
                    last="Monacatoocha">Monacatoocha</person> (as the <person last="Tanacharison">
                    Half King </person>was out at his hunting Cabbin on <place>little Beaver
                    Creek,</place> about 15 Miles off ) and inform’d him by <person first="John"
                    last="Davidson">my Indian Interpreter</person>, that I was sent a Messenger to
                    the<person rank="General"> French General</person>; and was ordered to call upon
                the Sachems of the <people peopleType="Indians"/>Six Nations, to acquaint them with
                it.—I gave him a String of Wampum, and a Twist of Tobacco, and desired him to send
                for the <person last="Tanacharison">Half King</person>;which he promised to do by a
                Runsner in the Morning, and for other Sachems.—I invited him and the other great Men
                present to my Tent, where they stay’d about an Hour and return’d. </p>

            <p n="16"> According to the best Observations I could make, Mr.<place placeType="home"
                    >Grist's</place>
                <place>Wills Creek</place>;Shanapins, or the Forks N. by W. or N. N. W. about 50
                Miles from that;and from thence to the Loggs-Town, the Course is nearly West about
                18 or 20 Miles;so that the whole Distance, as we went and computed it, is at least
                135 or 140 Miles from our back Inhabitants. </p>

            </heading>

            <entry>
                <p n="17">
                    <date day="25" month="October">October 25th</date> Came to Town four of ten
                    Frenchmen that deserted from a Company at the Cuscuscas, which lies at the Mouth
                    of this River;I got the following Account from them. They were sent from <place
                        placeType="city">New Orleans</place> with 100 Men, and 8 Canoe Loads of
                    Provisions to this Place;where they expected to have met the same Number of Men,
                    from <place>the Forts this Side Lake Erie,</place> to convey them and the Stores
                    up, who were not arrived when they ran off. </p>



                <p n="18"> I enquired into the Situation of the French, on the <place
                        placeType="river">Mississippi</place>, their Number, and what Forts they had
                    built: They inform’d me, That there were four small Forts between <place
                        placeType="city">New Orleans</place> and the <place>Black Islands,</place>
                    garrison’d with about 30 or 40 Men, and a few small Pieces, in each: That at
                        <place placeType="city">New Orleans</place>, which is near the Mouth of the
                        <place placeType="river">Missisippi</place>, there are 35 Comspanies, of 40
                    Men each, with a pretty strong Fort mountsing 8 Carriage Guns; and at the <place
                        placeType="islands">Black Islands</place> there are sevseral Companies, and
                    a Fort with 6 Guns. <place placeType="islands">The Black Islands</place> are
                    about 130 Leagues above the Mouth of the <place placeType="river">Ohio</place>, which is about 350 above <place
                        placeType="city">New Orleans</place>: They also acquainted me, that there
                    was a small pallisado’d Fort on the <place placeType="river">Ohio</place>, at the <place>Mouth of the Obaish
                        about 60 Leagues from the Missisippi: The Obaish heads near the West End of
                            <place placeType="lake">Lake Erie</place>, and affords the Communication
                        between the French on Missisippi and those on the Lakes.</place> These
                    Deserters came up from the lower <place placeType="city">Shanoah Town</place>
                    with one Brown, an Indian Trader, and were going to <place placeType="city"
                        >Philadelphia.</place>
                </p>



                <p n="19">
                    <time timeType="evening">About 3 o’Clock this Evening</time> the <person
                        last="Tanacharison">Half King</person>came to Town;I went up and invited him
                    and Davison, privately, to my Tent, and desir’d him to relate some of the
                    Particulars of his Journey to the French Commandant,s and Reception there;and to
                    give me an Account of the Ways and Distance. He told me, that the nearest and
                    levellest Way was now impassable, by Reason of many large miry Savannas; that we
                    must be obliged to go by <place placeType="city" colony="Pennsylvania"
                        >Venango,</place> and should not get to the near Fort under 5 or 6 Night’s
                    Sleep, good Travelling. When he went to the Fort, he said he was received in a
                    very stern Manner by the late Commander; Who ask’d him very abruptly, what he
                    had come about, and to declare his Business, which he said he did in the
                    following Speech. </p>

                <p n="20"> Fathers, I am come to tell you your own Speeches; what your own Mouths
                    have declared. Fathers, You, in former Days, set a Silver Bason before us,s
                    wherein there was the Leg of a Beaver, and desir’d of all Nations to come and
                    eat of it;to eat in Peace and Plenty, and not to be churlish to one another; and
                    that if any such Person should be found to be a Disturber, I here lay down by
                    the Edge of the Dish a Rod, which you must scourge them with;and if I your
                    Father, should get foolish, in my old Days, I desire you may use it upon me as
                    well as others. </p>

                <p n="21"> Now Fathers, it is you that are the Disturbers in this Land, by coming
                    and building your Towns, and taking it away unknown to us, and by Force. </p>

                <p n="22"> Fathers, We kindled a Fire a long Time ago, at a Place called <place
                        placeType="city">Montreal,</place> where we desired you to stay, and not to
                    come and instrude upon our Land. I now desire you may dispatch to that Place;
                    for be it known to you, Fathers, that this is our Land, and not yours </p>

                <p n="23"> Fathers, I desire you may hear me in Civilness;if not, we must handle
                    that Rod which was laid down for the Use of the obstrepersous. If you had come
                    in a peaceable Manner, like our Brothers the English, we should not have been
                    against your trading with us, as they do;but to come, Fathers, and build great
                    Houses upon our Land, and to take it by Force, is what we cannot submit to. </p>

                <p n="24"> Fathers, Both you and the English are white, we live in a Country
                    between; therefore the Land belongs to neither one nor t’other: But the Great
                    Being above allow’d it to be a Place of Ressidence for us;so Fathers, I desire
                    you to withdraw, as I have done our Brothers the English;for I will keep you at
                    Arms length: I lay this down as a Trial for both, to see which will have the
                    greatsest Regard to it, and that Side we will stand by, and make equal Sharers
                    with us. Our Brothers the English have heard this, and I come now to tell it to
                    you, for I am not afraid to discharge you off this Land. </p>

                <p n="25"> This he said was the Substance of what he said to the General, who made
                    this Reply. 15 Miles asunder, and a large Waggon Road between;they are both
                    built after the same Model, but different in the Size;that on the Lake the
                    largest; he gave me a Plan of them, of his own drawing. Now my Child, I have
                    heard your Speech, you spoke first, but it is my Time to speak now. Where is my
                    Wampum that you took away, with the Marks of Towns in it? This Wampum I do not
                    know, which you have discharged me off the Land with;but you need not put
                    yourself to the Trouble of speaking, for I will not hear you: I am not afraid of
                    Flies, or Musquitos, for Indians are such as those; I tell you, down that River
                    I will go, and will build upon it, according to my Command: If the River was
                    block’d up, I have Forces sufficient to burst it open, and tread under my Feet
                    all that stand in Opposition, together with their Alliances;for my Force is as
                    the Sand upon the Sea Shore: Therefore, here is your Wampum, I fling it at you.
                    Child, you talk foolish; you say this Land belongs to you, but there is not the
                    Black of my Nail yours: I saw that Land sooner than you did, before the
                    Shannoahs and you were at War: Lead was the Man that went down, and took Poss
                    session of that River: It is my Land, and I will have it, let who will stand up
                    for, or say against it. I’ll buy and sell with the Engslish, (mockingly). If
                    People will be rul’d by me, they may expect Kindness, but not else. </p>

                        I dare say, to you their Friends and Allies. I was desired, Brothers, by

                        to call upon you, the Sachems of the Nations, to inform you of it, and to

                        likewise desired me to apply to you for some of your young Men, to conduct
                        and provide Provisions for us on our Way, and be a Safeguard against those
                        French Indians who have taken up the Hatchet against us. I have spoke this
                        particularly to you, Brothers, because his Honour our Governor treats you as
                        good Friends and Allies, and holds you in great Esteem. To confirm what I
                        have said, I give you this String of Wampum </speech></p>

                        People: We shall put Heart in Hand, and speak to our Fathers the French
                        concerning the Speech they made to me, and you may depend that we will
                        endeavour to be your Guard. Brother, as you have asked my Advice, I hope you
                        will be ruled by it, and stay till I can provide a Company to go with you:
                        The French Speech-Belt is not here, I have it to go for to my hunting

                    contrary to my Inclination, I thanked him in the most suitable Manner I could,s
                    and told him that my Busisness required the greatest Expedition, and would not
                    admit of that Delay: He was not well pleased that I should offer to go before
                    the Time he had appointed, and told me that he could not consent to our going
                    without a Guard, for Fear some Accident should befal us, and draw a Reflection
                    upon him; bessides, says he, this is a Matter of no small Moment, and must not
                    be entered into without due Consideration;for now I intend to deliver up the

                    Waters were growing cold, and the Winter advancing, which obliged them to go
                    into Quarters: But they might assursedly expect them in the Spring, with a far
                    greater Number; and desired that they might be quite passive, and not to inters
                    meddle, unless they had a Mind to draw all their Force upon them, for that they
                    expected to fight the English three Years, (as they supposed there would be some
                    Attempts made to stop them) in which Time they should conquer, but if they
                    should prove equally strong, that they and the English, would join to cut them
                    all off, and divide the Land between them;that tho’ they had lost their General,

                soon as they arrived: When I found them so pressing in their Request, and knew that
                returnsing of Wampum was the abolishing of Agreements; and givsing this up, was
                shaking of all Dependence upon the French, I consented to stay, as I believed an

                himself by his Wife’s Sickness, (I believe, by Fear of the French ) but that the

                        treated us with the greatest Complaisance.The Wine, as they dosed themselves
                        pretty plentifully with it, soon banished the Restraint which at first
                        appear’d in their Conversation, and gave a License to their Tongues to
                        reveal their Sentiments more freely.They told me, That it was their absolute
                        Design to take Possession of the <place placeType="region">Ohio</place>, and
                        by G— they would do it;for that they were sensible the English could raise
                        two Men for their one;yet they knew, their Motions were too slow and
                        dilatory to prevent any Undertaking of theirs. </place></p>

                    and what rather confirms this Opinion, I was enquiring of the Commander, by what

                    Drivers which were obliged to ride) gave up our Horses for Packs, to assist
                    along with the Baggage;I put myself in an Indian walksing Dress, and continued
                    with them three Days, till I found there was no Probability of their getting
                    in,s in any reasonable Time;the Horses grew less able to travel every Day;the
                    Cold increased very fast, and the Roads were becoming much worse by a deep
                    Snow,s continually freezing;and as I was uneasy to get back, to make Report of
                    my Proceedings to his Honour the <person rank="Governor" first="Robert"
                        last="Dinwiddie"/>Governor, I determined to prosecute my Journey the nearest
                    Way through the Woods, on Foot.</p>
                <p n="62">Accordingly I left Mr. Vanbraam in Charge of our Baggage, with Money and
                    Directions, to provide Necessaries from Place to Place for themselves and
                    Horses, and to make the most consvenient Dispatch in. </p>
                <p n="63"> I took my necessary Papers, pulled off my Cloaths; tied myself up in a
                    Match Coat; and with my Pack at my Back with my Papers and Provisions in it, and
                    a Gun, set out with Mr. Gist, fitted in the same Manner, on Wednesday the 26th.
                    The Day following, just after we had passed a Place called the Murdering-Town,s
                    where we intended to quit the Path, and steer across the Country for Shannapins
                    Town, we fell in with a Party of French Indians, who had lain in Wait for us;
                    one of them fired at <person first="Christopher" last="Gist">Mr. Gist</person>
                    or me, not 15 Steps, but fortunately missed. We took this fellow into Custody,s
                    and kept him till about <time timeType="evening">9 o’Clock</time> at Night, and
                    then let him go,s and walked all the remaining Part of the Night without making
                    any Stop, that we might get the Start, so far, as to be out of the Reach of
                    their Pursuit the next Day, as we were well assured they would follow our Tract
                    as soon as it was light : The next Day we constinued travelling till quite dark,
                    and got to the River about two Miles above Shannapins; we expected to have found
                    the River frozen,s but it was not, only about 50 Yards from each Shore;the Ice I
                    suppose had broke up above, for it was driving in vast Quantities. ish;I put out
                    my setting Pole to try to stop the Raft, that the Ice might pass by, when the
                    Rapidity of the Stream threw it with so much Violence against the Pole, that it
                    jirked me out into ten Feet Water, but I fortunately saved myself by catching
                    hold of one of the Raft Logs;notwithstanding all our Efforts we could not get
                    the Raft to either Shore, but were obliged, as we were near an Island, to quit
                    our Raft and make to it. </p>
                <p n="64">I enquir’d of <person rank="Captain" last="Riparti">Capt. Riparti</person>
                    about the Boy that was carried by, as it was done while the Command devolved on
                    him, bestween the Death of the late General, and the Arrival of the present; he
                    acknowledged, that a Boy had been carried past, and that the Indians had two or
                    three white Men’s Scalps (I was told by some of the Indians at Venango Eight)
                    but prestended to have forgot the Name of the Place that the Boy came from, and
                    all the Particulars, though he question’d him for some Hours, as they were
                    carrying him past: I likewise ensquired what they had done with <person

                        last="MascClocklan" first="James">James MacsClocklan</person>, two
                    Pensylvania Traders, whom they had taken, with all their Goods: They told me,s
                    that they had been sent to Canada, but were now returned Home. This Evening I
                    received an Answer to his Honour the Govsernor’s Letter from the Commandant.

                <p n="65"><date month="December" day="15" year="1753">15th,</date> The Commandant
                    ordered a plentiful Store of Liquor, Provision,to be put on Board our Canoe, and
                    appeared to be extremely complaisant, though he was exerting every Arstifice
                    that he could invent to set our own Indians at Variance with us, to prevent
                    their going ’til after our Departure: Pressents, Rewards, and every Thing that
                    could be suggested by him or his Officers. —— I can’t say that ever in my Life I
                    suffer’d so much Anxiety as I did in this Affair;I saw that every Stratsagem
                    that the most fruitful Brain could invent, was practised, to win the <person last="Tanacharison">Half King</person>
                    to their Interest, and that leaving Him here was giving them the Opportunity
                    they aimed at. —— I went to the <person last="Tanacharison"> Half
                    King</person>,s and press’d him in the strongest Terms to go: He told me the
                    Commandant would not discharge him ’til the Morning. I then went to the
                    Commandant, and desired him to do their Business, and complain’d of ill
                    Treatment;for keeping them, as they were Part of my Company, was detainsing
                    me;which he promised not to do,s but to forward my Joursney as much as he could:
                    He protested he did not keep them, but was ignorant of the Cause of their Stay;
                    though I soon found it out :—He had promised them a Present of Guns, if they
                    would wait ’til the Morning.As I was very much press’d, by the Indians, to wait
                    this Day for them, I consented,s on a Promise, That nothing should hinsder them
                    in the Morning </p>

            <entry>
                <p n="66"><date month="December" day="16" year="1753">16th</date>,/date> The French
                    were not slack in their Inventions to keep the Indians this Day also;but as they
                    were obligated, accordsing to Promise, to give the Present, they then
                    endeavoured to try the Power of Liquor, which I doubt not would have presvailed
                    at any other Time than this, but I urged and insisted with the King so closely
                    upon his Word, that he refrained, and set off with us as he had engaged. </p>
                <p n="67">We had a tedious and very fatiguing Passage down the Creek, several Times
                    we had like to have been staved against Rocks, and many Times were obliged all
                    Hands to get out and remain in the Water Half an Hour or more, getting over the
                    Shoals;at one Place the Ice had lodged and made it impasssable by Water;
                    therefore we were obliged to carry our Canoe across a Neck of Land, a Quarter of
                    a Mile over. We did not reach <place placeType="fort">Venango</place>, till the
                        <date month="December" day="22" year="1753">22d</date>, where we met with
                    our Horses. by a deep Snow, continually freezing;and as I was uneasy to get
                    back, to make Report of my Proceedings to his Honour the Governor, I determined
                    to prosecute my Journey the nearest Way through the Woods, on Foot. This Creek
                    is extremely crooked, I dare say the Distance between the Fort and Venango can’t
                    be less than 130 Miles, to follow the Meanders.</p>

                <p n="68"><date month="December" day="23" year="1753">23d.</date> When I got Things
                    ready to set off, I sent for the HalfmKing, to know whether he intended to go
                    with us, or by Waster, he told me that White-Thunder had hurt himself much, and
                    was sick and unable to walk, therefore he was obliged to carry him down in a
                    Canoe: As I found he intended to stay here a Day or two, and knew that Monsieur
                    Joncaire would employ every Scheme to set him against the English as he had
                    before done; I told him I hoped he would guard against his Flattery, and let no
                    fine Speeches influence him in their Fasvour: He desired I might not be
                    concerned, for he knew the French too well, for any Thing to engage him in their
                    Behalf, and though he could not go down with us, he would endeavour to meet at
                    the Forks with Joseph Campbell, to deliver a Speech for me to carry to his
                    Honour the Governor. He told me he would order the young Hunter to attend us,s
                    and get Provision,if wanted. </p>
                <p n="69">Our Horses were now so weak and feeble, and the Baggage heavy, as we here
                    obliged to provide all the Necessaries that the Journey would require; that we
                    doubted much their persforming it: therefore myself and others (except the

                    follow the Meanders. Accordingly I left Mr. Vanbraam in Charge of our Baggage,s
                    with Money and Directions, to provide Necessaries from Place to Place for
                    themselves and Horses, and to make the most consvenient Dispatch in.</p>
                <p n="70">I took my necessary Papers, pulled off my Cloaths; tied myself up in a

                    up above, for it was driving in vast Quantities. There was no Way for getting
                    over but on a Raft, which we set about, with but one poor Hatchet, and got
                    finished just afster Sun-setting, after a whole Days Work;we got it launched,
                    and on Board of it, and set off;but before we were Half Way over, we were jammed
                    in the Ice in such a Manner that we exspected every Moment our Raft to sink, and
                    ourselves to perish;I put out my setting Pole to try to stop the Raft, that the
                    Ice might pass by, when the Rapidity of the Stream threw it with so much
                    Violence against the Pole, that it jirked me out into ten Feet Water,s but I
                    fortunately saved myself by catching hold of one of the Raft Logs;
                    notwithstanding all our Efforts we could not get the Raft to either Shore, but
                    were obliged, as we were near an Island, to quit our Raft and make to it. </p>
                <p n="71">The Cold was so extremely severe, that Mr. Gist, had all his Fingers, and
                    some of his Toes frozen, and the Water was shut up so hard, that we found no
                    Difficulty in getting off the Island, on the Ice, in the Morning, and went to
                        <place placeType="home">Mr. Frazier’ s.</place> We met here with 20 Warriors
                    who were going to the Southward to War, but coming to a Place upon the Head of
                    the great Cunnaway, where they found seven People killed and scalped, all but
                    one Woman with very light Hair, they turned about and ran back, for Fear the
                        <people peopleType="Indians">Inhabitants</people>should rise and take them
                    as the Authors of the Murder: They resport that the People were lying about the
                    House, and some of them much torn and eaten by Hogs: By the Marks that were
                    left, they say they were French Indians of the Ottaway Nastion,that did it. </p>
                <p n="72">As we intended to take Horses here, and it required some Time to find
                    them, I went up about three Miles to the Mouth of Yaughyaughgane to visit Queen
                    Alliquippa, who had expressed great Concern that we passed her in going to the
                    Fort. I made her a Present of a Matchcoat and a Bottle of Rum, which latster was

                    occasioned very uncomfortable Lodgings, especially after we had left our Tent,
