            <intro> The Journal of <person rank="Major" first="George" last="Washington">George

            <p n="1"> In <date month="October" year="1753">October of 1753</date>, <person
                    rank="Major" first="George" last="Washington">George Washington</person>, a
                21-year-old major in the Virginia militia, volunteered to carry a letter from the
                    <person rank="Governor" first="Robert" last="Dinwiddie">governor</person> of
                    <place placeType="colony">Virginia</place> to the <person rank="Commander">French
                    commander</person> of the forts recently built on the headwaters of the <place
                    placeType="river">Ohio River</place> in northwestern <place placeType="colony"
                    >Pennsylvania</place>. The French had recently expanded their military
                operations from the Great Lakes into the <place placeType="region">Ohio
                    country</place>, and had spent the <date year="1753">summer of 1753</date>
                building forts and roads along the <place placeType="river">Allegheny River</place>,
                with the design of linking their trade routes and sphere of influence down the
                    <place placeType="river">Ohio</place> to the <place placeType="river"
                    >Mississippi</place>. Virginia governor <person rank="Governor" first="Robert" last="Dinwiddie"
                    >Robert Dinwiddie</person> believed them to be in violation of treaties and
                claims that made those territories part of <place placeType="colony"
                    colony="Virginia">Virginia</place> and <place placeType="colony"
                    colony="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</place>, as granted by the British Crown, and
                his letter to the <person rank="Commander">French commander</person> instructed him to cease, desist,
                and depart from those regions.</p>

            <p n="2">
                <person rank="Major" first="George" last="Washington">Washington</person> left
                    <place placeType="city" colony="Virginia">Williamsburg</place>, Virginia on
                    <date month="October" day="31" year="1753">October 31, 1753</date>, and
                completed the round trip of more than 1,000 miles by horse, foot, canoe, and raft in
                about ten weeks. He was accompanied by <person first="Christopher" last="Gist"
                    >Christopher Gist</person>, an explorer and surveyor employed by the Ohio
                Company, by <person first="Jacob" last="Van Braam">Jacob Van Braam</person> a French
                Interpreter, <people peopleType="Natives">four Indian traders and baggage men, and various Indian
                    delegations and guards</people>, including Tanacharison, known as the "<person
                    last="Tanacharison">Half King</person>.” <person rank="Major" first="George"
                    last="Washington">Washington</person> accomplished far more than the mere
                delivery of a letter: he practiced diplomacy to keep the <people peopleType="Natives">Native
                    leaders</people> allied to the English cause; he interviewed <people peopleType="French">French
                    deserters</people> and reported on the extent of French military posts between
                <place placeType="city" colony="Louisiana Territory">New Orleans</place> and the <place placeType="lake"
                    >Great Lakes</place>; he reconnoitered the Forks of the <place placeType="river"
                    >Ohio</place> with an eye to the proper site for building a fort; and he
                inspected and reported on the construction of the new French forts and made
                estimates of their strength and preparations for the following year&apos;s
                expeditions.</p>

            <p n="3">When <person rank="Major" first="George" last="Washington">Washington</person>
                arrived back in <place placeType="city" colony="Virginia">Williamsburg</place> on
                    <date month="January" day="16" year="1754">January 16, 1754</date>, <person
                    rank="Governor" first="Robert" last="Dinwiddie">Governor Dinwiddie</person>
                immediately asked him to prepare a written report for the House of Burgesses.
                    <person rank="Governor" first="Robert" last="Dinwiddie">Dinwiddie</person> then
                had this report printed, and it became very popular reading. The Virginia
                legislature was so pleased with his mission and his report that they voted him a £50
                reward. The Journal of <person rank="Major" first="George" last="Washington">Major
                    George Washington</person> was reprinted in various colonial newspapers as far
                away as <place placeType="city" colony="Massachusetts">Boston</place>, and a British edition was
                issued in <place placeType="city">London</place> later that same year, for which
                    <person rank="Major" first="George" last="Washington">Washington</person> sent
                materials for the preparation of a map.</p>

            <p n="4"> This online electronic text edition of the Journal is based on the first
                American edition published at <place placeType="city" colony="Virginia">Williamsburg
                </place>in <date month="February" year="1754">February 1754</date>. It includes some
                annotations for the nonspecialist reader and a note on the text discussing the
                sources and the few emendations made. </p>



            <p n="5">It is accompanied by 2 maps, attached as supplementary PDF files: one is a copy
                of the map that appeared with the London edition, showing the whole region from the
                    <place placeType="ocean">Atlantic</place> to the <place placeType="river"
                    >Mississippi</place>, based on materials furnished by <person rank="Major"
                    first="George" last="Washington">Washington</person>; the other is a detail
                derived from the map accompanying <person first="Thomas" last="Jefferson">Thomas
                    Jefferson</person>&apos;s Notes on the State of <place placeType="State"
                    >Virginia (1787)</place>, showing the frontier region through which<person
                    rank="Major" first="George" last="Washington"> Washington</person> travelled,
                between <place placeType="city" colony="Maryland">Cumberland (Md.)</place> and
                    <place placeType="lake">Lake Erie</place>. Of the two, the <person
                    first="Thomas" last="Jefferson">Jefferson</person> map shows the geography with
                somewhat greater accuracy. </p>

                        1753</date>, I was commissioned and appointed by <person rank="Governor"
                        first="Robert" last="Dinwiddie">the Honourable Robert Dinwiddie, Esq;
                        Governor,&amp;c. of Virginia</person>, to visit and deliver a Letter to the
                        <person rank="Commandant">Commandant of the French Forces on the Ohio</person>, and set out on
                    the intended Journey the same Day; <date day="1" month="November" year="1753"
                        >the next</date> I arrived at <place placeType="city"
                    >Fredericksburg</place>, and engaged Mr. <person first="Jacob" last="Van Braam"
                        >Jacob Van Bramm</person>, to be my French Interpreter; and proceeded with
                    him to <place placeType="city">Alexandria</place>, where we provided
                    Necessaries; from thence we went to <place placeType="city">Winchester</place>
                    and got Baggage, Horses, &amp;c. and from thence we pursued the new Road to
                        <place placeType="creek">Wills-Creek</place>, where we arrived the <date
                        day="14" month="November" year="1753">14th of November</date>.</p>


                <p n="7">Here I engaged <person last="Gist" first="Christopher">Mr. Gist</person> to
                    pilot us out, and also hired four others as Servitors, <person first="Barnaby"
                        last="Currin">Barnaby Currin</person>, and <person first="John"
                        last="MacQuire">John MacQuire</person>, <people peopleType="Natives">Indian Traders</people>,
                        <person first="Henry" last="Steward">Henry Steward</person>, and <person
                        last="Jenkin" first="William">William Jenkins</person>, and in Company with
                    those Persons, left the Inhabitants the Day following.</p>

                <p n="8">The excessive Rains and vast Quantity of Snow that had fallen, prevented
                    our reaching <place placeType="home">Mr. Frazier's</place> an Indian Trader, at
                    the Mouth of <place>Turtle Creek,</place> on <place placeType="river"
                        >Monongahela</place>, till <date year="1753" month="November" day="22"
                        >Thursday the 22d</date>. We were informed here, that Expresses were sent a
                    few Days ago to the Traders down the River, to acquaint them with the French
                    General&apos;s Death, and the Return of the major Part of the French Army into
                    Winter Quarters.</p>

                <p n="9">The Waters were quite impassable, without swimming our Horses; which
                    obliged us to get the Loan of a Canoe from <person last="Frazier"
                        >Frasier</person>, and to send <person first="Barnaby" last="Currin">Barnaby
                        Currin</person>, and <person last="Steward" first="Henry">Henry
                        Steward</person>, down <place placeType="river">Monongahela</place>, with
                    our Baggage, to meet us at the <place placeType="region">Forks of Ohio</place>,
                    about 10 Miles, to cross <place placeType="river">Aligany</place> . </p>

                <p n="10"> As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in viewing the Rivers,
                    and the<place placeType="river"> Land in the Fork</place>, which I think
                    extremely well situated for a Fort, as it has the absolute Command of both
                    Rivers. The Land at the Point is 20 or 25 Feet above the common Surface of the
                    Water, and a considerable Bottom of flat, well-timbered Land all around it, very
                    convenient for Building: The Rivers are each a Quarter of a Mile, or more,
                    across, and run here very near at right Angles: <place placeType="river"
                        >Aligany</place> bearing N. E. and <place placeType="river"
                        >Monongahela</place> S. E. the former of these two is a very rapid and swift
                    running Water, the other deep and still, without any perceptible Fall. </p>

                <p n="11"> About two Miles from this, on the South East Side of the River, at the
                    Place where the Ohio Company intended to erect a Fort, lives <person
                        rank="chief" last="Shingiss">Shingiss, king of the Delawares</person>; we
                    call&apos;d upon him, to invite him to Council at the <place placeType="city"
                        >Loggs Town</place>. </p>

                <p n="12"> As I had taken a good deal of Notice Yesterday of the Situation at the
                        <place>Forks</place>, my Curiosity led me to examine this more particularly,
                    and I think it greatly inferior, either for Defence or Advantages; especially
                    the latter; for a Fort at the Forks would be equally well situated on <place
                        placeType="river">Ohio</place>, and have the entire Command of <place
                        placeType="river">Monongahela</place>, which runs up to our Settlements and
                    is extremely well design&apos;d for Water Carriage, as it is of a deep still
                    Nature; besides, a Fort at the Fork might be built at a much less Expence, than
                    at the other Place.——— </p>

                <p n="13"> Nature has well contrived the lower Place, for Water Defence; but the
                    Hill whereon it must stand being about a Quarter of a Mile in Length, and then
                    descending gradually on the Land Side, will render it difficult and very
                    expensive, making a sufficient Fortification there.—The whole Flat upon the Hill
                    must be taken in, or the Side next the Descent made extremely high; or else the
                    Hill cut away: Otherwise, the Enemy may raise Batteries within that Distance
                    without being expos&apos;d to a single Shot from the Fort.</p>

                <p n="14">
                    <person rank="chief" last="Shingiss">Shingiss</person> attended us to the <place
                        placeType="city">Loggs-Town</place>, where we arrived between Sun-setting
                    and Dark, the <date month="November" day="25" year="1753">25th</date> Day after
                    I left <place placeType="city">Williamsburg</place>: We travelled over some
                    extreme good, and bad Land, to get to this Place. — </p>

                <p n="15"> As soon as I came into Town, I went to <person rank="chief"
                        last="Monacatoocha">Monacatoocha</person> (as the <person
                        last="Tanacharison"> Half King </person>was out at his hunting Cabbin on
                        <place>little Beaver Creek</place>, about 15 Miles off ) and inform&apos;d
                    him by <person first="John" last="Davidson">my Indian Interpreter</person>, that
                    I was sent a Messenger to the<person rank="General"> French General</person>;
                    and was ordered to call upon the <people peopleType="Natives">Sachems of the Six
                        Nations</people>, to acquaint them with it.—I gave him a String of Wampum,
                    and a Twist of Tobacco, and desired him to send for the <person
                        last="Tanacharison">Half King</person>; which he promised to do by a Runner
                    in the Morning, and for other Sachems.—I invited him and the other great Men
                    present to my Tent, where they stay&apos;d about an Hour and return&apos;d. </p>

                <p n="16"> According to the best Observations I could make, Mr. <place
                        placeType="home">Gist's</place>
                    <place> Wills Creek</place>; Shanapins, or the Forks N. by W. or N. N. W. about
                    50 Miles from that; and from thence to the <place placeType="city"
                        >Loggs-Town</place>, the Course is nearly West about 18 or 20 Miles; so that
                    the whole Distance, as we went and computed it, is at least 135 or 140 Miles
                    from our back Inhabitants. </p>

            <entry>
                <p n="17">
                    <date day="25" month="November" year="1753">25th</date>, Came to Town four of
                    ten Frenchmen that deserted from a Company at the Cuscuscas, which lies at the
                    Mouth of this River; I got the following Account from them. They were sent from
                    <place placeType="city" colony="Louisiana Territory">New Orleans</place> with 100 Men, and 8 Canoe Loads
                    of Provisions to this Place; where they expected to have met the same Number of
                    Men, from the Forts this Side <place placeType="lake">Lake Erie</place> to
                    convey them and the Stores up, who were not arrived when they ran off. </p>



                <p n="18"> I enquired into the Situation of the French, on the <place
                        placeType="river">Missisippi</place>, their Number, and what Forts they had
                    built: They inform&apos;d me, That there were four small Forts between <place
                        placeType="city" colony="Louisiana Territory">New Orleans</place> and the <place placeType="islands"
                        >Black Islands</place>, garrison&apos;d with about 30 or 40 Men, and a few
                    small Pieces, in each: That at <place placeType="city" colony="Louisiana Territory">New Orleans</place>,
                    which is near the Mouth of the <place placeType="river">Missisippi</place>,
                    there are 35 Companies, of 40 Men each, with a pretty strong Fort mounting 8
                    Carriage Guns; and at the <place placeType="islands">Black Islands</place> there
                    are sevseral Companies, and a Fort with 6 Guns. The <place placeType="islands"
                        >Black Islands</place> are about 130 Leagues above the Mouth of the <place
                        placeType="river">Ohio</place>, which is about 350 above <place
                            placeType="city" colony="Louisiana Territory">New Orleans</place>: They also acquainted me, that there
                    was a small pallisado&apos;d Fort on the <place placeType="river">Ohio</place>,
                    at the <place>Mouth of the Obaish</place> about 60 Leagues from the Missisippi:

                    These Deserters came up from the lower <place placeType="city">Shanoah

                    and were going to <place placeType="city" colony="Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</place>. </p>



                <p n="19">
                    <time timeType="evening">About 3 o&apos;Clock this Evening</time> the <person
                        last="Tanacharison">Half-King</person> came to Town; I went up and invited
                    him and <person last="Davison">Davison</person>, privately, to my Tent, and
                    desir&apos;d him to relate some of the Particulars of his Journey to the French
                    Commandant&apos;s and Reception there; and to give me an Account of the Ways and
                    Distance. He told me, that the nearest and levellest Way was now impassable, by
                    Reason of many large miry Savannas; that we must be obliged to go by <place
                        placeType="city" colony="Pennsylvania">Venango</place>, and should not get
                    to the near Fort under 5 or 6 Night&apos;s Sleep, good Travelling. When he went
                    to the Fort, he said he was received in a very stern Manner by the late
                    Commander; Who ask&apos;d him very abruptly, what he had come about, and to
                    declare his Business, which he said he did in the following Speech. </p>

                <p n="20"> Fathers, I am come to tell you your own Speeches; what your own Mouths
                    have declared. Fathers, You, in former Days, set a Silver Bason before us,
                    wherein there was the Leg of a Beaver, and desir&apos;d of all Nations to come
                    and eat of it; to eat in Peace and Plenty, and not to be churlish to one
                    another; and that if any such Person should be found to be a Disturber, I here
                    lay down by the Edge of the Dish a Rod, which you must scourge them with; and if
                    I your Father, should get foolish, in my old Days, I desire you may use it upon
                    me as well as others. </p>

                <p n="21"> Now Fathers, it is you that are the Disturbers in this Land, by coming
                    and building your Towns, and taking it away unknown to us, and by Force. </p>

                <p n="22"> Fathers, We kindled a Fire a long Time ago, at a Place called <place
                        placeType="city">Montreal</place>, where we desired you to stay, and not to
                    come and intrude upon our Land. I now desire you may dispatch to that Place; for
                    be it known to you, Fathers, that this is our Land, and not yours. </p>

                <p n="23"> Fathers, I desire you may hear me in Civilness; if not, we must handle
                    that Rod which was laid down for the Use of the obstreperous. If you had come in
                    a peaceable Manner, like our Brothers the English, we should not have been
                    against your trading with us, as they do; but to come, Fathers, and build great
                    Houses upon our Land, and to take it by Force, is what we cannot submit to. </p>

                <p n="24"> Fathers, Both you and the English are white, we live in a Country
                    between; therefore the Land belongs to neither one nor t&apos;other: But the
                    Great Being above allow&apos;d it to be a Place of Ressidence for us; so
                    Fathers, I desire you to withdraw, as I have done our Brothers the English; for
                    I will keep you at Arms length: I lay this down as a Trial for both, to see
                    which will have the greatsest Regard to it, and that Side we will stand by, and
                    make equal Sharers with us. Our Brothers the English have heard this, and I come
                    now to tell it to you, for I am not afraid to discharge you off this Land. </p>

                <p n="25"> This he said was the Substance of what he said to the General, who made
                    this Reply.</p>

                <p n="26"> Now <person last="Tanacharison">my Child</person>, I have heard your
                    Speech, you spoke first, but it is my Time to speak now. Where is my Wampum that
                    you took away, with the Marks of Towns in it? This Wampum I do not know, which
                    you have discharged me off the Land with; but you need not put yourself to the
                    Trouble of speaking, for I will not hear you: I am not afraid of Flies, or
                    Musquitos, for Indians are such as those; I tell you, down that River I will go,
                    and will build upon it, according to my Command: If the River was block’d up, I
                    have Forces sufficient to burst it open, and tread under my Feet all that stand
                    in Opposition, together with their Alliances; for my Force is as the Sand upon
                    the Sea Shore: Therefore, here is your Wampum, I fling it at you. Child, you
                    talk foolish; you say this Land belongs to you, but there is not the Black of my
                    Nail yours: I saw that Land sooner than you did, before the Shannoahs and you
                    were at War: Lead was the Man that went down, and took Possession of that River:
                    It is my Land, and I will have it, let who will stand up for, or say against it.
                    I’ll buy and sell with the English, (mockingly). If People will be rul&apos;d by
                    me, they may expect Kindness, but not else.</p>

                <p n="27">The <person last="Tanacharison">Half-King</person> told me he enquired of
                    the General after two Englishmen that were made Prisoners, and received this
                    Answer.</p>

                <p n="28">
                    <speech>Child, You think it is a very great Hardship that I made Prisoners of

                        concern yourself with it, we took and carried them to Canada, to get

                    a Plan of them, of his own drawing.</p>

                <p n="31"> They also asked what sort of a Boy it was that was taken from the

                        French Commandant, of very great Importance to your Brothers the English;and
                        I dare say, to you their Friends and Allies. I was desired, Brothers, by
                        your Brother the <person first="Robert" last="Dinwiddie">Governor</person>,
                        to call upon you, the Sachems of the Nations, to inform you of it, and to
                        ask your Advice and Assistance to proceed the nearest and best Road to the
                        French. You see, Brothers, I have got thus far on my Journey. His Honour
                        likewise desired me to apply to you for some of your young Men, to conduct
                        and provide Provisions for us on our Way, and be a Safeguard against those
                        French Indians who have taken up the Hatchet against us. I have spoke this
                        particularly to you, Brothers, because his Honour our Governor treats you as
                        good Friends and Allies, and holds you in great Esteem. To confirm what I
                        have said, I give you this String of Wampum. </speech>

                            Governor</person> has desired of me, I return you this Answer. I rely
                        upon you as a Brother ought to do, as you say we are Brothers and one
                        People: We shall put Heart in Hand, and speak to our Fathers the French
                        concerning the Speech they made to me, and you may depend that we will
                        endeavour to be your Guard. Brother, as you have asked my Advice, I hope you
                        will be ruled by it, and stay till I can provide a Company to go with you:
                        The French Speech-Belt is not here, I have it to go for to my hunting
                        Cabbin; likewise the People which I have ordered in, are not yet come, nor
                        cannot till the third Night from this, till which Time, Brother, I must beg
                        you to stay. I intend to send a Guard of Mingo&apos;s, Shannoahs, and
                        Delawares, that our Brothers may see the Love and Loyalty we bear
                        them.</speech>

                    contrary to my Inclination, I thanked him in the most suitable Manner I could,
                    and told him that my Busisness required the greatest Expedition, and would not
                    admit of that Delay: He was not well pleased that I should offer to go before
                    the Time he had appointed, and told me that he could not consent to our going
                    without a Guard, for Fear some Accident should befal us, and draw a Reflection
                    upon him; besides, says he, this is a Matter of no small Moment, and must not be
                    entered into without due Consideration; for now I intend to deliver up the
                    French-Speech-Belt, and make the <people peopleType="Natives">Shanoahs and
                        Delawares</people> do the same; and accordingly he gave Orders to <person

                        <date>Wednesday Night</date> with the Wampum, and two Men of their Nation to
                    be in Readiness to set out with us next Morning. As I found it was impossible to
                    get off without affronting them in the most egregious Manner, I consented to
                    stay. </p>

                <p n="37"> I gave them back a String of Wampum that I met with at <person

                    desired them to repeat it over again, which they postponed doing till they met
                    in full Council with the Shannoahs and Delaware Chiefs. </p>

                    and told them that they intended to have been down the River this Fall, but the
                    Waters were growing cold, and the Winter advancing, which obliged them to go
                    into Quarters: But they might assuredly expect them in the Spring, with a far
                    greater Number; and desired that they might be quite passive, and not to inters
                    meddle, unless they had a Mind to draw all their Force upon them, for that they
                    expected to fight the English three Years, (as they supposed there would be some
                    Attempts made to stop them) in which Time they should conquer, but if they
                    should prove equally strong, that they and the English, would join to cut them
                    all off, and divide the Land between them; that tho&apos; they had lost their

                <p n="43"><date month="November" day="30" year="1753"> 30th</date>. Last Night the
                    great Men assembled to their Councils House, to consult further about this
                    Journey, and who were to go; the Result of which was, that only three of their
                    Chiefs, with one of their best Hunters, should be our Convoy: The Reason which
                    they gave for not sending more, after what had been proposed at Council the<date
                        month="November" day="26" year="1753"> 26th</date>, was, that a greater
                    Number might give the French Suspicions of some bad Design, and cause them to be
                    treated rudely: But I rather think they could not get their Hunters in. We set
                    out about <time>9 o&apos;Clock</time> with the <people peopleType="Natives">Half
                        King, Jeskakake, White Thunder, and the Hunter</people>, and travelled on
                    the Road to <place placeType="fort">Venango</place>, where we arrived the <date
                        month="December" day="4" year="1753">4th of December</date>, without any
                    Thing remarkable happening but a continued Series of bad Weather. This is an old
                    Indian Town, situated at the Mouth of <place placeType="creek">French
                        Creek</place> on <place placeType="river">Ohio</place>, and lies near N.
                    about 60 Miles from the <place placeType="city">Loggs-Town</place>, but more
                    than 70 the Way we were obliged to go. We found the French Colours hoisted at a
                    House which they drove <person first="John" last="Frazier">Mr. John
                        Frazier</person>, an English Subject, from; I immediately repaired to it, to
                    know where the Commander resided: There were three Officers, one of whom,
                        <person rank="Captain" last="Joncaire">Capt. Joncaire </person>,
                    inform&apos;d me, that he had the Command of the <place placeType="region"
                        >Ohio</place>, but that there was a General Officer at the near Fort, which
                    he adsvised me to for an Answer. He invited us to sup with them, and treated us
                    with the greatest Complaisance. The Wine, as they dosed themselves pretty
                    plentifully with it, soon banished the Restraint which at first appear&apos;d in
                    their Conversation, and gave a License to their Tongues to reveal their
                    Sentiments more freely. They told me, That it was their absolute Design to take
                    Possession of the <place placeType="region">Ohio</place>, and by G— they would
                    do it; for that they were sensible the English could raise two Men for their
                    one; yet they knew, their Motions were too slow and dilatory to prevent any
                    Undertaking of theirs. They pretend to have an undoubted Right to the <place
                        placeType="river">River</place>, from a Discovery made by one La Sol 60
                    Years ago; and the Rise of this Expedition is, to prevent our settling on the
                    River or Waters of it, as they have heard of some Families moving out in Order
                    thereto. From the best Intelligence I could get, there have been 1500 Men on
                    this Side <place placeType="lake">Ontario Lake</place>, but upon the Death of
                    the General all were recalled to about 6 or 700, who were left to garrison four
                    Forts, 150 or there abouts in each, the first of which is on <place
                        placeType="creek">French Creek</place>, near a small Lake, about 60 Miles
                    from <place placeType="fort">Venango</place>, near N. N. W. the next lies on
                        <place placeType="lake">Lake Erie</place>, where the greatest Part of their
                    Stores are kept, about 15 Miles from the other; from that it is 120 Miles to the
                    carrying Place, at the Falls of Lake Erie, where there is a small Fort which
                    they lodge their Goods at, in bringing them from <place placeType="city"
                        >Montreal</place>, the Place that all their Stores come from: The next Fort
                    lies about 20 Miles from this, on <place placeType="lake">Ontario Lake</place>;
                    between this Fort and <place placeType="city">Montreal</place> there are three
                    others, the first of which is near opposite to the English <place
                        placeType="fort">Fort Oswego</place>. From the Fort on Lake Erie to Montreal
                    is about 600 Miles, which they say requires no more, if good Weather, than four
                    Weeks Voyage, if they go in Barks or large Vessels, that they can cross the
                    Lake; but if they come in Canoes it will require 5 or 6 Weeks, for they are
                    oblig&apos;d to keep under the Shore. </p>

                    I did not think their Company agreeable, as I had heard him say a good deal in
                    Dispraise of Indians in general; but another Motive prevented me from bringing
                    them into his Company; I knew he was Interpreter, and a Person of very great
                    Influence among the Indians, and had lately used all possible Means to draw them
                    over to their Interest; therefore I was desirous of giving no Opportunity that
                    could be avoided. When they came in, there was great Pleasure express&apos;d at
                    seeing them; he wonder&apos;d how they could be so near without coming to visit
                    him, made several trifling Presents, and applied Liquor so fast, that they were

                    to be put on Board our Canoe, and appeared to be extremely complaisant, though
                    he was exerting every Artifice that he could invent to set our own Indians at
                    Variance with us, to prevent their going &apos;til after our Departure:
                    Presents, Rewards, and every Thing that could be suggested by him or his
                    Officers. —— I can&apos;t say that ever in my Life I suffer&apos;d so much
                    Anxiety as I did in this Affair; I saw that every Stratagem that the most
                    fruitful Brain could invent, was practised, to win the <person
                        last="Tanacharison">Half King</person> to their Interest, and that leaving
                    Him here was giving them the Opportunity they aimed at. —— I went to the <person
                        last="Tanacharison">Half King</person>, and press&apos;d him in the
                    strongest Terms to go: He told me the Commandant would not discharge him
                    &apos;til the Morning. I then went to the Commandant, and desired him to do
                    their Business, and complain&apos;d of ill Treatment; for keeping them, as they
                    were Part of my Company, was detaining me; which he promised not to do, but to
                    forward my Journey as much as he could: He protested he did not keep them, but
                    was ignorant of the Cause of their Stay; though I soon found it out:—He had
                    promised them a Present of Guns, if they would wait &apos;til the Morning.</p>
                <p n="60">As I was very much press&apos;d, by the Indians, to wait this Day for
                    them, I consented, on a Promise, That nothing should hinder them in the
                    Morning.</p>
            </entry>
            <entry>
                <p n="61"><date month="December" day="16" year="1753">16th</date>, The French were
                    not slack in their Inventions to keep the Indians this Day also; but as they
                    were obligated, according to Promise, to give the Present, they then endeavoured
                    to try the Power of Liquor, which I doubt not would have prevailed at any other
                    Time than this, but I urged and insisted with the King so closely upon his Word,
                    that he refrained, and set off with us as he had engaged.</p>
                <p n="62"> We had a tedious and very fatiguing Passage down the Creek, several Times
                    we had like to have been staved against Rocks, and many Times were obliged all
                    Hands to get out and remain in the Water Half an Hour or more, getting over the
                    Shoals; at one Place the Ice had lodged and made it impassable by Water;
                    therefore we were obliged to carry our Canoe across a Neck of Land, a Quarter of
                    a Mile over. We did not reach <place placeType="fort">Venango</place>, till the
                        <date day="22" month="December" year="1753">22d</date>, where we met with
                    our Horses. </p>
                <p n="63">This Creek is extremely crooked, I dare say the Distance between the Fort
                    and <place placeType="city" colony="Northwest Territory">Venango</place> can&apos;t be less than 130 Miles,
                    to follow the Meanders.</p>
            </entry>
            <entry>
                <p n="64"><date month="December" day="23" year="1753">23d</date>. When I got Things
                    ready to set off, I sent for the <person last="Tanacharison">Half King</person>,
                    to know whether he intended to go with us, or by Waster, he told me that <person
                        last="White-Thunder">White-Thunder</person> had hurt himself much, and was
                    sick and unable to walk, therefore he was obliged to carry him down in a Canoe:
                    As I found he intended to stay here a Day or two, and knew that <person
                        last="Joncaire">Monsieur Joncaire</person> would employ every Scheme to set
                    him against the English as he had before done; I told him I hoped he would guard
                    against his Flattery, and let no fine Speeches influence him in their Favour: He
                    desired I might not be concerned, for he knew the French too well, for any Thing
                    to engage him in their Behalf, and though he could not go down with us, he would
                    endeavour to meet at the Forks with <person first="Joseph" last="Campbell"
                        >Joseph Campbell</person>, to deliver a Speech for me to carry to <person
                        rank="Governor" first="Robert" last="Dinwiddie">his Honour the
                        Governor</person>. He told me he would order the young Hunter to attend us,
                    and get Provision, if wanted. </p>
                <p n="65">Our Horses were now so weak and feeble, and the Baggage heavy, as we here
                    obliged to provide all the Necessaries that the Journey would require; that we
                    doubted much their performing it: therefore myself and others (except the
                    Drivers which were obliged to ride) gave up our Horses for Packs, to assist
                    along with the Baggage; I put myself in an Indian walking Dress, and continued
                    with them three Days, till I found there was no Probability of their getting in,
                    in any reasonable Time; the Horses grew less able to travel every Day; the Cold
                    increased very fast, and the Roads were becoming much worse by a deep Snow,
                    continually freezing; and as I was uneasy to get back, to make Report of my
                    Proceedings to <person rank="Governor" first="Robert" last="Dinwiddie">his
                        Honour the Governor</person>, I determined to prosecute my Journey the
                    nearest Way through the Woods, on Foot.</p>
                <p n="66">Accordingly I left <person>Mr. Vanbraam</person> in Charge of our Baggage,
                    with Money and Directions, to provide Necessaries from Place to Place for
                    themselves and Horses, and to make the most convenient Dispatch in. </p>
                <p n="67"> I took my necessary Papers, pulled off my Cloaths; tied myself up in a
                    Match Coat; and with my Pack at my Back with my Papers and Provisions in it, and
                    a Gun, set out with <person first="Christopher" last="Gist">Mr. Gist</person>,
                    fitted in the same Manner, on Wednesday the 26th. The Day following, just after
                    we had passed a Place called <place placeType="city" colony="Pennsylvania">the Murdering-Town</place>,
                    where we intended to quit the Path, and steer across the Country for <place
                        placeType="city">Shannapins Town</place>, we fell in with a Party of French
                    Indians, who had lain in Wait for us; one of them fired at <person
                        first="Christopher" last="Gist">Mr. Gist</person> or me, not 15 Steps, but
                    fortunately missed. We took this fellow into Custody, and kept him till about
                        <time timeType="night">9 o&apos;Clock</time> at Night, and then let him
                    go, and walked all the remaining Part of the Night without making any Stop, that
                    we might get the Start, so far, as to be out of the Reach of their Pursuit the
                    next Day, as we were well assured they would follow our Tract as soon as it was
                    light: The next Day we constinued travelling till quite dark, and got to the
                    River about two Miles above Shannapins; we expected to have found the River
                    frozen,s but it was not, only about 50 Yards from each Shore; the Ice I suppose
                    had broke up above, for it was driving in vast Quantities.</p>

                <p n="68">There was no Way for getting over but on a Raft, which we set about, with
                    but one poor Hatchet, and got finished just after Sun-setting, after a whole
                    Days Work; we got it launched, and on Board of it, and set off; but before we
                    were Half Way over, we were jammed in the Ice in such a Manner that we expected
                    every Moment our Raft to sink, and ourselves to perish; I put out my setting
                    Pole to try to stop the Raft, that the Ice might pass by, when the Rapidity of
                    the Stream threw it with so much Violence against the Pole, that it jirked me
                    out into ten Feet Water, but I fortunately saved myself by catching hold of one
                    of the Raft Logs; notwithstanding all our Efforts we could not get the Raft to
                    either Shore, but were obliged, as we were near an Island, to quit our Raft and
                    make to it. </p>

                <p n="69">The Cold was so extremely severe, that <person first="Christopher"
                        last="Gist"> Mr. Gist</person>, had all his Fingers, and some of his Toes
                    frozen, and the Water was shut up so hard, that we found no Difficulty in
                    getting off the Island, on the Ice, in the Morning, and went to <place
                        placeType="home">Mr. Frazier&apos;s</place>. We met here with 20 Warriors
                    who were going to the Southward to War, but coming to a Place upon the Head of
                    the great Cunnaway, where they found seven People killed and scalped, all but
                    one Woman with very light Hair, they turned about and ran back, for Fear the
                        <people peopleType="Natives">Inhabitants</people> should rise and take them
                    as the Authors of the Murder: They resport that the People were lying about the
                    House, and some of them much torn and eaten by Hogs: By the Marks that were
                    left, they say they were French Indians of the Ottaway Nastion,that did it. </p>
                <p n="70">As we intended to take Horses here, and it required some Time to find
                    them, I went up about three Miles to the Mouth of <place placeType="river"
                        >Yaughyaughgane</place> to visit <person last="Aliquippa">Queen
                        Alliquippa</person>, who had expressed great Concern that we passed her in
                    going to the Fort. I made her a Present of a Matchcoat and a Bottle of Rum,
                    which latter was thought much the best Present of the two. </p>

                    to the <date month="December" day="15" year="1753">15th</date>, there was but
                    one Day but it rained or snowed incessantly; and throughout the whole Journey we
                    met with nothing but one continued Series of cold wet Weather, which occasioned
                    very uncomfortable Lodgings, especially after we had left our Tent, which was
                    some Screen from the Inclemency of it.</p>
