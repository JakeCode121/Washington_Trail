            <p n="1">In <date month="October" year="1753,"/> October 1753 <person first="George" last="Washington"
                    >,</person> a 21-year-old major in the Virginia militia, volunteered to carry a
                letter from the <person>governor of Virginia</person>to the<person> French
                    commander</person> of the forts recently built on the headwaters of the Ohio
                River in northwestern <place>Pennsylvania.</place> The French had recently expanded
                their military operations from the Great Lakes into the<place> Ohio country,</place>
                and had spent the <date year="1753">summer of 1753</date> building forts and roads along the
                    <place>Allegheny River,</place> with the design of linking their trade routes
                and sphere of influence down the Ohio to the Mississippi. Virginia governor<person
                    first="Robert" last="Dinwiddie"/> believed them to be in violation of treaties
                and claims that made those territories part of Virginia and Pennsylvania, as granted
                by the British Crown, and his letter to the<person> French commander</person>
                instructed him to cease, desist, and depart from those regions. </p>

            <p n="2">
                <person last="Washington"/>left <place city="Williamsburg" colon="Virginia"/>on
                    <date month="October" day="31" year="1753"> October 31st 1753 </date> and completed the round trip of
                more than 1,000 miles by horse, foot, canoe, and raft in about ten weeks. He was
                accompanied by <person>Christopher Gist,</person> an explorer and surveyor employed
                by the Ohio Company, by <person first="Jacob" last="Van Braam,"/>J a French
                Interpreter, <people>four Indian traders and baggage-men, and various Indian
                    delegations and guards,</people> including <person last="Tanacharison"/>, known
                as the “Half-King.” <person last="Washington"/> accomplished far more than the mere
                delivery of a letter: he practiced diplomacy to keep the Native leaders allied to
                the English cause; he interviewed French deserters and reported P on the extent of
                French military posts between New Orleans and the Great Lakes; he reconnoitered the
                Forks of the Ohio with an eye to the proper site for building a fort; and he
                inspected and reported on the construction of the new French forts and made
                estimates of their strength and preparations for the following year’s
                expeditions.</p>

            <p n="3">When <name last="Washington"/> arrived back in <place name="Williamsburg"/> on
                    <date month="January" date="16" year="1754"> January 16 1754</date>, Governor Dinwiddie immediately
                asked him to prepare a written report for the House of Burgesses. Dinwiddie then had
                this eport printed, and it became very popular reading. The Virginia legislature was
                so pleased with his mission and his report that they voted him a £50 reward. The
                Journal of Major George Washington was reprinted in various colonial newspapers as
                far away as Boston, and a British edition was issued in London later that same year,
                for which Washington sent materials for the preparation of a map.</p>

            <p n="4"> This online electronic text edition of the Journal is based on the first
                American edition published at Williamsburg in February 1754. It includes some
                annotations for the nonspecialist reader and a note on the text discussing the
                sources and the few emendations made. </p>



            <p n="5">It is accompanied by 2 maps, attached as supplementary PDF files: one is a copy
                of the map that appeared with the London edition, showing the whole region from the
                    <place> Atlantic</place> to the <place>Mississippi,</place> based on materials
                furnished by Washington; the other is a detail derived from the map accompanying
                Thomas Jefferson’s Notes on the State of Virginia (1787), showing the frontier
                region through which Washington travelled, between Cumberland (Md.) and Lake Erie.
                Of the two, the Jefferson map shows the geography with somewhat greater accuracy. </p>

        <body>
            <p n="6">I was commissioned and appointed by the <name>Honourable Robert Dinwiddie, Esq;
                    Governor,&amp;c. of Virginia,</name> to visit and deliver a Letter to the
                    <name>Commandant of the French Forces on the Ohio,</name> and set out on the in-
                tended Journey the same Day; the next, Iarrived at <place>Fredericksburg,</place>
                and engaged Mr. <name first="Jacob" last="Van braam"/>, to be my French Interpreter;
                and proceeded with him to <place>Alex- andria,</place> where we provided Necessaries
                ; from thence we went to <place name="Winchester">,</place> and got Baggage, Horses,
                &amp;c. and from thence we pursued the new Road to <place>Wills-Creek,</place> where
                we arrived the <date day="14" month="November" year="1753"> 14th of November.</date></p>


            <p n="7">Here I engaged<person last="Gist"></person> Mr Gist to pilot us out, and also hired four
                others as Servitors,<person first="Barnaby" last="Currin"/>, and <person
                    first="John" last="MacQuire"/>, In- dian Traders, <name>Henry Steward,</name>
                and <name>William Jenkins,</name> and in Company with those Persons, left the
                Inhabitants the Day following.</p>

            <p n="8">The excessive Rains and vast Quantity of Snow that had fallen, prevented our
                reaching Mr.<person last="Frazier’s"/> an Indian Trader, at the Mouth of
                    <place>Turtle-Creek,</place> on Monongahela, till <date day="22" month="November" year="1753">Thursday the 22d.</date>
                We were informed here, that Expresses were sent a few Days ago to the Traders down
                the River, to acquaint them with the French General’s Death, and the Return of the
                major Part of the French Army into Winter Quarters.</p>

            <p n="9"> The Waters were quite impassable, without swimming our Horses; which obliged
                us to get the Loan of a Canoe from <name last="Frazier">,</name> and to send
                    <name>Barnaby Currin,</name> and <name>Henry Steward,</name> down Monongahela,
                with our Baggage, to meet us at the <place>Forks of Ohio,</place> about 10 Miles, to
                cross Aligany. </p>

            <p n="10"> As I got down before the Canoe, I spent some Time in view- ing the Rivers,
                and the<place> Land in the Fork,</place> which I think ex- tremely well situated for
                a Fort, as it has the absolut Com- mand of both Rivers. The Land at the Point is 20
                or 25 Feet above the common Surface of the Water, and a considerable Bottom of flat,
                well-timbered Land all around it, very conve- nient for Building : The Rivers are
                each a Quarter of a Mile, or more, across, and run here very near at right Angles :
                    <place>Aligany</place> bearing N. E. and Monongahela S. E. the former of these
                two is a very rapid and swift running Water, the other deep and still, without any
                perceptible Fall. </p>

            <p n="11"> About two Miles from this, on the South East Side of the River, at the Place
                where the Ohio Company intended to erect a Fort, lives <name>Shingiss, king of the
                    Delawares;</name> we call’d upon him, to invite him to Council at the
                Loggs-Town. </p>

            <p n="12"> As I had taken a good deal of Notice Yesterday of the Situation at the
                    <place>Forks,</place> my Curiosity led me to examine this more particularly, and
                I think it greatly inferior, either for Defence or Advantages ; especially the
                latter ; for a Fort at the Forks would be equally well situated
                    on<place>Ohio,</place> and have the entire Command of
                    <place>Monongahela,</place> which runs up to our Settlements and is extremely
                well design’d for Water Carriage, as it is of a deep still Nature ; besides, a Fort
                at the Fork might be built at a much less Expence, than at the other Place.——— </p>

            <p n="13"> Nature has well contrived the lower Place, for Water Defence; but the Hill
                whereon it must stand being about a Quarter of a Mile in Length, and then descending
                gradually on the Land Side, will render it difficult and very expensive, making a
                sufficient Fortification there.—The whole Flat upon the Hill must be taken in, or
                the Side next the Descent made extremely high ; or else the Hill cut away :
                Otherwise, the En- emy may raise Batteries within that Distance without being
                expos’d to a single Shot from the Fort. </p>

            <p n="14"> Shingiss attended us to the <place>Loggs-Town</place>, where we arrived
                between Sun-setting and Dark, the <date day="24" month="November">25th Day </date>after I left <place>Wil-
                    liamsburg:</place> We travelled over some extreme good, and bad Land, to get to
                this Place. — </p>

            <p n="15"> As soon as I came into Town, I went to <name>Monacatoocha</name> (as the
                    <person> Half-King </person>was out at his hunting-Cabbin on <place>little
                    Beaver Creek,</place> about 15 Miles off ) and inform’d him by <person
                    first="John" last="Davi-
                    son">my Indian
                    Interpreter,</person> that I was sent a Messenger to the French General; and was
                ordered to call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations, to acquaint them with it.—I
                gave him a String of Wampum, and a Twist of Tobacco, and desired him to send for the
                Half-King ; which he promised to do by a Run- ner in the Morning, and for other
                Sachems.—I invited him and the other great Men present to my Tent, where they stay’d
                about an Hour and return’d. </p>

            <p n="16"> According to the best Observations I could make, Mr.<person last="Gist’s"/>
                <place>Wills-Creek</place> ; Shanapins, or the Forks N. by W. or N. N. W. about 50
                Miles from that ; and from thence to the Loggs-Town, the Course is nearly West about
                18 or 20 Miles ; so that the whole Distance, as we went and computed it, is at least
                135 or 140 Miles from our back Inhabitants. </p>



            <entry>
                <p n="17">
                    <date day="25th" month="November" year="1753">25th,</date> Came to Town four of ten Frenchmen that deserted from
                    a Company at the Cuscuscas, which lies at the Mouth of this River ; I got the
                    following Account from them. They were sent from <place>New Orleans</place> with
                    100 Men, and 8 Canoe Loads of Provisions to this Place ; where they expected to
                    have met the same Number of Men, from <place>the Forts this Side Lake
                        Erie,</place> to convey them and the Stores up, who were not arrived when
                    they ran off. </p>



                <p n="18"> I enquired into the Situation of the French, on the Missi- sippi, their
                    Number, and what Forts they had built: They inform’d me, That there were four
                    small Forts between <place>New Orleans</place> and the
                        <place>Black-Islands,</place> garrison’d with about 30 or 40 Men, and a few
                    small Pieces, in each : That at <place>New-Orleans, which is near the Mouth of
                        the Missisippi,</place> there are 35 Com- panies, of 40 Men each, with a
                    pretty strong Fort mount- ing 8 Carriage Guns; and at the
                        <place>Black-Islands</place> there are sev- eral Companies, and a Fort with
                    6 Guns. <place>The Black-Islands are about 130 Leagues above the Mouth of the
                        Ohio, which is about 350 above New-Orleans :</place> They also acquainted
                    me, that there was a small pallisado’d Fort on the Ohio, at the <place>Mouth of
                        the Obaish about 60 Leagues from the Missisippi: The Obaish heads near the
                        West End of Lake Erie, and affords the Communication between the French on
                        Missisippi and those on the Lakes.</place> These Deserters came up from the
                    lower <place>Shanoah Town</place> with one Brown, an Indian Trader, and were
                    going to <place>Philadelphia.</place>
                </p>



                <p n="19">
                    <time>About3 o’Clock this Evening</time> the <person last="Half-King"/>came to
                    Town ; I went up and invited him and Davison, privately, to my Tent, and desir’d
                    him to relate some of the Particulars of his Journey to the French Commandant,
                    and Reception there ; and to give me an Account of the Ways and Distance. He
                    told me, that the nearest and levellest Way was now impassable, by Reason of
                    many large miry Savannas; that we must be obliged to go by
                        <place>Venango,</place> and should not get to the near Fort under 5 or 6
                    Night’s Sleep, good Travelling. When he went to the Fort, he said he was
                    received in a very stern Manner by the late Commander; Who ask’d him very
                    abruptly, what he had come about, and to declare his Business, which he said he
                    did in the following Speech. </p>

                <p n="20"> Fathers, I am come to tell you your own Speeches; what your own Mouths
                    have declared. Fathers, You, in former Days, set a Silver Bason before us,
                    wherein there was the Leg of a Beaver, and desir’d of all Nations to come and
                    eat of it ; to eat in Peace and Plenty, and not to be churlish to one another ;
                    and that if any such Person should be found to be a Disturber, I here lay down
                    by the Edge of the Dish a Rod, which you must scourge them with ; and if I your
                    Father, should get foolish, in my old Days, I desire you may use it upon me as
                    well as others. </p>

                <p n="21"> Now Fathers, it is you that are the Disturbers in this Land, by coming
                    and building your Towns, and taking it away unknown to us, and by Force. </p>

                <p n="22"> Fathers, We kindled a Fire a long Time ago, at a Place called
                        <place>Montreal,</place> where we desired you to stay, and not to come and
                    in- trude upon our Land. I now desire you may dispatch to that Place ; for be it
                    known to you, Fathers, that this is our Land, and not yours </p>

                <p n="23"> Fathers, I desire you may hear me in Civilness ; if not, we must handle
                    that Rod which was laid down for the Use of the obstreper- ous. If you had come
                    in a peaceable Manner, like our Brothers the English, we should not have been
                    against your trading with us, as they do ; but to come, Fathers, and build great
                    Houses upon our Land, and to take it by Force, is what we cannot submit to. </p>

                <p n="24"> Fathers, Both you and the English are white, we live in a Country
                    between; therefore the Land belongs to neither one nor t’other : But the Great
                    Being above allow’d it to be a Place of Res- idence for us ; so Fathers, I
                    desire you to withdraw, as I have done our Brothers the English ; for I will
                    keep you at Arms length : I lay this down as a Trial for both, to see which will
                    have the great- est Regard to it, and that Side we will stand by, and make equal
                    Sharers with us. Our Brothers the English have heard this, and I come now to
                    tell it to you, for I am not afraid to discharge you off this Land. </p>

                <p n="25"> This he said was the Substance of what he said to the General, who made
                    this Reply. 15 Miles asunder, and a large Waggon Road between ; they are both
                    built after the same Model, but different in the Size ; that on the Lake the
                    largest; he gave me a Plan of them, of his own drawing. Now my Child, I have
                    heard your Speech, you spoke first, but it is my Time to speak now. Where is my
                    Wampum that you took away, with the Marks of Towns in it? This Wampum I do not
                    know, which you have discharged me off the Land with ; but you need not put
                    yourself to the Trouble of speaking, for I will not hear you : I am not afraid
                    of Flies, or Musquitos, for Indians are such as those; I tell you, down that
                    River I will go, and will build upon it, according to my Command : If the River
                    was block’d up, I have Forces sufficient to burst it open, and tread under my
                    Feet all that stand in Opposition, together with their Alliances ; for my Force
                    is as the Sand upon the Sea Shore: Therefore, here is your Wampum, I fling it at
                    you. Child, you talk foolish; you say this Land belongs to you, but there is not
                    the Black of my Nail yours : I saw that Land sooner than you did, before the
                    Shannoahs and you were at War : Lead was the Man that went down, and took Pos-
                    session of that River : It is my Land, and I will have it, let who will stand up
                    for, or say against it. I’ll buy and sell with the Eng- lish, (mockingly). If
                    People will be rul’d by me, they may expect Kindness, but not else. </p>

                <p n="26"> The <person>Half-King</person> told me he enquired of the General after
                    two Englishmen that were made Prisoners, and received this Answer. hild, You
                    think it is a very great Hardship that I made Pris- oners of those two People at
                        <place>Venango,</place> don’t you concern yourself with it, we took and
                    carried them to <place>Canada,</place> to get Intelligence of what the English
                    were doing in <place>Virginia.</place> He informed me that they had built two
                    Forts, one on <place>Lake Erie,</place> and another on
                        <place>French-Creek,</place> near a small Lake about 15 Miles asunder, and a
                    large Waggon Road between ; they are both built after the same Model, but
                    different in the Size ; that on the Lake the largest; he gave me a Plan of them,
                    of his own drawing.</p>

                <p n="27"> The Indians enquired very particularly after their Brothers in

                </p>

                <p n="28"> They also asked what sort of a Boy it was that was taken from the
                    South-Branch ; for they had, by some Indians, heard that a Party of French
                    Indians had carried a white Boy by the <place>Cuscusca Town,</place> towards the
                    Lakes. <date day="26" month="November" year="">26th.</date> We met in Council at the Long-House, <time>about 9
                        o’Clock,</time> where I spoke to them as follows,<speech>Brothers, I have
                        called you together in Council, by Order of your Brother the<person>
                            Governor of Virginia,</person> to acquaint you that I am sent, with all
                        possible Dispatch, to visit, and deliver a Let- ter to the French
                        Commandant, of very great Importance to your Brothers the English ; and I
                        dare say, to you their Friends and Allies. I was desired, Brothers, by your
                        Brother the <person>Governor,</person> to call upon you, the Sachems of the
                        Nations, to inform you of it, and to ask your Advice and Assistance to
                        proceed the nearest and best Road to the French. You see, Brothers, I have
                        got thus far on my Journey. His Honour likewise desired me to apply to you
                        for some of your young Men, to conduct and provide Provisions for us on our
                        Way, and be a Safeguard against those French Indians who have taken up the
                        Hatchet against us. I have spoke this particularly to you, Brothers, because
                        his Honour our Governor treats you as good Friends and Allies, and holds you
                        in great Esteem. To confirm what I have said, I give you this String of
                        Wampum </speech></p>

                <p n="29"> After they had considered some Time on the above, the Half-King got up
                    and spoke.<speech> Now, my Brothers, in Regard to what my Brother the Governor
                        has desired of me, I return you this Answer. I rely upon you as a Brother
                        ought to do, as you say we are Brothers and one People: We shall put Heart
                        in Hand, and speak to our Fathers the French concerning the Speech they made
                        to me, and you may depend that we will endeavour to be your Guard. Brother,
                        as you have asked my Advice, I hope you will be ruled by it, and stay till I
                        can provide a Company to go with you: The French Speech-Belt is not here, I
                        have it to go for to my hunting Cabbin; likewise the People which I have
                        ordered in, are not yet come, nor cannot till the third Night from this,
                        till which Time, Brother, I must beg you to stay. I intend to send a Guard
                        of Mingo’s, Shannoahs, and Del- awares, that our Brothers may see the Love
                        and Loyalty we bear them.</speech></p>


                <p n="30"> As I had Orders to make all possible Dispatch, and waiting here was very
                    contrary to my Inclination, I thanked him in the most suitable Manner I could,
                    and told him that my Busi- ness required the greatest Expedition, and would not
                    admit of that Delay : He was not well pleased that I should offer to go before
                    the Time he had appointed, and told me that he could not consent to our going
                    without a Guard, for Fear some Ac- cident should befal us, and draw a Reflection
                    upon him; be- sides, says he, this is a Matter of no small Moment, and must not
                    be entered into without due Consideration ; for now I in- tend to deliver up the
                    French-Speech-Belt, and make the <place>Sha- noahs and Delawares</place> do the
                    same; and accordingly he gave Orders to <person>King Shingiss,</person> who was
                    present, to attend on <date>Wednes- day Night</date> with the Wampum, and two
                    Men of their Nation to be in Readiness to set out with us next Morning. As I
                    found it was impossible to get off without affronting them in the most egregious
                    Manner, I consented to stay. </p>

                <p n="31"> I gave them back a String of Wampum that I met with at <person>Mr.
                        Frazier’ s,</person> which they had sent with a Speech to his Hon- our the
                    Governor, to inform him, that three Nations of French Indians, viz. Chippoways,
                    Ottoways, and Orundacks, had taken up the Hatchet against the English, and
                    desired them to repeat it over again, which they postponed doing till they met
                    in full Council with the Shannoahs and Delaware Chiefs. </p>

                    complied with his Honour the Governor’s Request, in providing Men, &amp;c.) to
                    know on what Business we were going to the French? this was a Question I all
                    along expected, and had provided as satisfactory Answers to, as I could, and
                    which allayed their Curiosity a little. </p>




                <p n="35">
                    <person>Monocatoocha</person> informed me, that an <person>Indian from
                            <place>Venango</place></person> brought News, a few Days ago, that the
                    French had called all the Mingos, Delawares, &amp;c. together at that Place, and
                    told them that they intended to have been down the River this Fall, but the
                    Waters were growing cold, and the Winter advancing, which obliged them to go
                    into Quarters : But they might assur- edly expect them in the Spring, with a far
                    greater Number; and desired that they might be quite passive, and not to inter-
                    meddle, unless they had a Mind to draw all their Force upon them, for that they
                    expected to fight the English three Years, (as they supposed there would be some
                    Attempts made to stop them) in which Time they should conquer, but if they
                    should prove equally strong, that they and the English, would join to cut them
                    all off, and divide the Land between them ; that tho’ they had lost their
                    General, and some few of their Soldiers, yet there were Men enough to reinforce
                    them, and make them Masters of the Ohio. </p>

                <p n="36"> This Speech, he said, was delivered to them by one <person>Captain
                        Joncaire</person> their Interpreter in Chief, living at <place>Venango,
                    </place>and a Man of Note in the Army. </p>

                <person>The Half-King and Monocatoocha,</person> came very early, and begged me to
                stay one Day more, for notwithstanding they had used all the Diligence in their
                Power, the Shanoah Chiefs had not brought the Wampum they ordered, but would
                certainlybeinTo-night;ifnot,theywoulddelaymenolon- ger, but would send it after us
                as soon as they arrived : When I found them so pressing in their Request, and knew
                that return- ing of Wampum was the abolishing of Agreements; and giv- ing this up,
                was shaking of all Dependence upon the French, I consented to stay, as I believed an
                Offence offered at this Cri- sis, might be attended with greater ill Consequence,
                than an- other Day’s Delay. They also informed me that <person>Shingiss</person>
                could not get in his Men, and was prevented from coming himself by his Wife’s
                Sickness, (I believe, by Fear of the French ) but that the Wampum of that Nation was
                lodged with <person>Custaloga</person> one of their Chiefs at
                    <place>Venango.</place> In the Evening late they came again and acquainted me
                that the Shannoahs were not yet come, but it should not retard the Prosecution of
                our Journey. He delivered in my Hearing, the Speeches that were to be made to the
                French, by <person>Jeskakake, one of their old Chiefs,</person> which was giving up
                the Belt the late Com- mandant had asked for, and repeating near the same Speech he
                himself had done before. He also delivered a String of Wampum to this Chief, which
                was sent by King Shingiss, to be given to <person>Custaloga,</person> with Or- ders
                to repair to the French, and deliver up the Wampum.He likewise gave a very large
                String of black and white Wampum, which was to be sent up immediately to the Six Na-
                tions, if the French refused to quit the Land at this Warning ; which was the third
                and last Time, and was the Right of this Jeskakake to deliver.</entry>

                    House, to consult further about this Journey, and who were to go ; the Result of
                    which was, that only three of their Chiefs, with one of their best Hunters,
                    should be our Convoy: The Reason which they gave for not sending more, after
                    what had been proposed at Council the 26th, was, that a greater Num- ber might
                    give the French Suspicions of some bad Design, and cause them to be treated
                    rudely: But I rather think they could not get their Hunters in.We set out about
                        <time>9 o’Clock</time> with the <people>Half-King, Jeskakake, White Thunder,
                        and the Hunter,</people> and travelled on the Road to

                    without any Thing remarkable happening but a continued Series of bad Weather.
                    This is <place>an old Indian Town, situated at the Mouth of French Creek on
                        Ohio, and lies near N. about 60 Miles from the Loggs-Town, but more than 70
                        the Way we were obliged to go.</place>We found the French Colours hoisted at
                    a House which they drove <person>Mr. John Frazier, an English Subject,</person>
                    from ; I im- mediately repaired to it, to know where the Commander re- sided:
                    There were three Officers, one of whom, <person>Capt. Jon- caire,</person>
                    inform’d me, that he had the Command of the Ohio, but that there was a General
                    Officer at the near Fort, which he ad- vised me to for an Answer. He invited us
                    to sup with them, and treated us with the greatest Complaisance.The Wine, as
                    they dosed themselves pretty plentifully with it, soon banished the Restraint
                    which at first appear’d in their Conversation, and gave a License to their
                    Tongues to reveal their Sentiments more freely.They told me, That it was their
                    absolute Design to take Possession of the Ohio, and by G— they would do it ; for
                    that they were sensible the English could raise two Men for their one ; yet they
                    knew, their Motions were too slow and dilatory to prevent any Undertaking of
                    theirs. They pretend to have an</p>

                    as he had but just heard that he came with me: He affected to be much concern’d
                    that I did not make free to bring them in before; I excused it in the best
                    Manner I was capable ; and told him I did not think their Company agreeable, as
                    I had heard him say a good deal in Dispraise of Indians in general ; but another
                    Motive prevented me from bringing them into his Company ; I knew he was
                    Interpreter, and a Person of very great Influence among the Indians, and had
                    lately used all possible Means to draw them over to their Interest; therefore I
                    was desirous of giving no Opportunity that could be avoided.When they came in,
                    there was great Pleasure express’d at seeing them ; he wonder’d how they could
                    be so near without coming to visit him, made several trifling Presents, and ap-
                    plied Liquor so fast, that they were soon render’d incapable of the Business
                    they came about, notwithstanding the Caution that was given.</p>

                    sober, and insisted very much that I should stay and hear what he had to say to
                    the French; I fain would have prevented his speak- ing any Thing, ’til he came
                    to the Commandant; but could not prevail: He told me, that at this Place a
                    Council Fire was kindled, where all their Business with these People was to be
                    transacted, and that the Management of the Indian Af- fairs was left solely to
                        <person>Monsieur Joncaire.</person> As I was desirous of knowing the Issue
                    of this, I agreed to stay, but sent our Horses a little Way up <place>French
                        Creek,</place> to raft over and encamp ; which I knew would make it near
                    Night.About 10 o’Clock they met in Council ; the King spoke much the same as he
                    had before done to the General, and offer’d the French Speech-Belt which had
                    before been demanded, with the Marks of four Towns on it, which <person>Monsieur
                        Joncaire</person> re- fused to receive ; but desired him to carry it to the

                    getting the Indians off To-day, as every Stratagem had been used to prevent
                    their going up with me : I had last Night left <person>John Davison (the Indian
                        Interpreter that I brought from the Loggs-Town with me)</person> strictly
                    charg’d not to be out of their Company, as I could not get them over to my Tent
                    (they having some Business with <person>Custaloga,</person> to know.the Reason
                    why he did not deliver up the French Belt which he had in Keeping) but was
                    obliged to send <person>Mr. Gist</person> over To-day to fetch them, which he
                    did with great Persuasion.</p>
                <p n="42"> At <time>11 o’Clock</time> we set out for the Fort; and were prevented
                    from arriving there ’til the 11th by excessive Rains, Snows, and bad Travelling,
                    through many Mires and Swamps, which we were obliged to pass, to avoid crossing
                    the Creek, which was impossible, either by fording or rafting, the Water was so

                    him with my Business, and offer’d my Commission and Letter, both of which he
                    desired me to keep ’til the arrival of <person>Monsieur Riparti,</person>
                    Captain, at the next Fort, who was sent for and expected every Hour. </p>
                <p n="45">This Commander is a Knight of the military Order of St. Lewis, and named
                        <person>Legardeur de St. Piere.</person> He is an elderly Gentleman, and has
                    much the Air of a Soldier; he was sent over to take the Command, immediately
                    upon the Death of the late General, and arrived here about seven Days before me. </p>
                <p n="46">At <time>2 o’Clock</time> the Gentleman that was sent for arrived, when I

                    Apartment for the Captain to trans- late, who understood a little English ;
                    after he had done it, the Commander desired I would walk in, and bring my
                    Interpreter to peruse and correct it, which I did.</p>

                <p n="47"><date day="13" month="December" year="1753">13th</date>, The chief Officers retired, to hold a Council of War, which gave me
                    an Opportunity of taking the Dimensions of the Fort, and making what
                    Observations I could.</p>
                <p n="48">It is situated on the South, or <place>West Fork of French Creek,</place>
                    near the Water, and is almost surrounded by the Creek, and a small Branch of it
                    which forms a Kind of an Island; four Houses compose the Sides; the Bastions are
                    made of Piles driven into the Ground, and about 12 Feet above, and sharp at Top,
                    with Port-Holes cut for Cannon and Loop-Holes for the small Arms to fire
                    through; there are eight 6 lb. Pieces mounted, two in each Bastion, and one
                    Piece of four Pound before the Gate; in the Bastions are a Guard-House, Cha-
                    pel, <place>Doctor’s Lodging,</place> and <place>the Commander’s private
                        Store,</place> round which are laid PlatForms for the Cannon and Men to
                    stand on : There are several Barracks without the Fort, for the Soldiers
                    Dwelling, covered, some with Bark, and some with Boards, made chiefly of Loggs :
                    There are also several other Houses, such as Stables, Smiths Shop..</p>

                <p n="49">I could get no certain Account of the Number of Men here ; but according
                    to the best Judgment I could form, there are an Hundred exclusive of Officers,
                    of which there are many. I also gave Orders to the People that were with me, to
                    take an exact Account of the Canoes that were haled up to convey their Forces
                    down in the Spring, which they did, and told 50 of Birch Bark, and 170 of Pine,
                    besides many others that were block’d out, in Readiness to make.</p>

                <p n="50"><date day="14" month="December" year="1753">14th</date>, As the Snow encreased very fast, and our Horses daily
                    became weaker, I sent them off unloaded, under the Care of<person> Barnaby
                        Currin</person> and two others, to make all convenient Dispatch to
                        <place>Venango,</place> and there wait our Arrival if there was a Prospect
                    of the Rivers freezing, if not, then to continue down to Shanapin’ s Town, at
                    the Forks of the Ohio, and there to wait ’til we came to
                        cross<place>Aligany,</place> intending myself to go down by Water, as I had
                    the Offer of a Canoe or Two.</p>
                <p n="51">As I found many Plots concerted to retard the Indians Business, and
                    prevent their returning with me; I endeavour’d all that lay in my Power to
                    frustrate their Schemes, and hurry them on to execute their intended Design;
                    they accordingly pressed for Admittance this Evening, which at Length was
                    granted them, privately, with the Commander and one or two other Officers: The
                        <person>Half-King</person> told me, that he offer’d the Wampum to the
                        <person>Commander,</person> who evaded taking it, and made many fair
                    Promises of Love and Friendship; said he wanted to live in Peace, and trade
                    amicably with them, as a Proof of which he would send some Goods immediately
                    down to the<place> Loggs-Town </place> for them; but I rather think the Design
                    of that is, to bring away all our straggling Traders they meet with, as I
                    privately understood they intended to carry an Officer, with them; and what
                    rather confirms this Opinion, I was enquiring of the Commander, by what
                    Authority he had made Prisoners of several of our English Subjects ; he told me
                    that the Country belong’d to them, that no Englishman had a Right to trade upon
                    those Waters ; and that he had Orders to make every Person Prisoner that
                    attempted it on the Ohio, or the Waters of it.</p>
                <p n="52"> I enquir’d of<person>Capt. Riparti </person> about the Boy that was
                    carried by, as it was done while the Command devolved on him, be- tween the
                    Death of the late General, and the Arrival of the present; he acknowledged, that
                    a Boy had been carried past, and that the Indians had two or three white Men’s
                    Scalps (I was told by some of the Indians at Venango Eight) but pre- tended to
                    have forgot the Name of the Place that the Boy came from, and all the
                    Particulars, though he question’d him for some Hours, as they were carrying him
                    past: I likewise en- quired what they had done with John Trotter and James Mac-
                    Clocklan, two Pensylvania Traders, whom they had taken, with all their Goods :
                    They told me, that they had been sent to Canada, but were now returned Home.
                    This Evening I received an Answer to his Honour the Gov- ernor’s Letter from the
                    Commandant. </p>
                <p n="53">There was no Way for getting over but on a Raft, which we set about, with
                    but one poor Hatchet, and got finished just af- ter Sun-setting, after a whole
                    Days Work ; we got it launched, and on Board of it, and set off ; but before we
                    were Half Way over, we were jammed in the Ice in such a Manner that we ex-

                    Store of Liquor, Provision, to be put on Board our Canoe, and appeared to be
                    extremely complaisant, though he was exerting every Ar- tifice that he could
                    invent to set our own Indians at Variance with us, to prevent their going ’til
                    after our Departure : Pres- ents, Rewards, and every Thing that could be
                    suggested by him or his Officers. —— I can’t say that ever in my Life I suffer’d
                    so much Anxiety as I did in this Affair ; I saw that every Strat- agem that the
                    most fruitful Brain could invent, was practised, to win the Half-King to their
                    Interest, and that leaving Him here was giving them the Opportunity they aimed
                    at. —— I went to the Half-King, and press’d him in the strongest Terms to go :
                    He told me the Commandant would not discharge him ’til the Morning. I then went
                    to the Commandant, and desired him to do their Business, and complain’d of ill
                    Treatment ; for keeping them, as they were Part of my Company, was detain- ing
                    me ; which he promised not to do, but to forward my Jour- ney as much as he
                    could : He protested he did not keep them, but was ignorant of the Cause of
                    their Stay; though I soon found it out :—He had promised them a Present of Guns,
                    if they would wait ’til the Morning.</p>
                <p n="55">As I was very much press’d, by the Indians, to wait this Day for them, I

                    the Indians this Day also ; but as they were obligated, accord- ing to Promise,
                    to give the Present, they then endeavoured to try the Power of Liquor, which I
                    doubt not would have pre- vailed at any other Time than this, but I urged and
                    insisted with the King so closely upon his Word, that he refrained, and set off
                    with us as he had engaged.</p>
                <p n="57"> We had a tedious and very fatiguing Passage down the Creek, several Times
                    we had like to have been staved against Rocks, and many Times were obliged all
                    Hands to get out and remain in the Water Half an Hour or more, getting over the
                    Shoals ; at one Place the Ice had lodged and made it impass- able by Water;
                    therefore we were obliged to carry our Canoe across a Neck of Land, a Quarter of
                    a Mile over. We did not reach Venango, till the 22d, where we met with our
                    Horses. </p>
                <p n="58">This Creek is extremely crooked, I dare say the Distance between the Fort
                    and <place>Venango</place> can’t be less than 130 Miles, to follow the

                        <person>the Half- King, </person>to know whether he intended to go with us,
                    or by Wa- ter, he told me that <person>White-Thunder </person>had hurt himself
                    much, and was sick and unable to walk, therefore he was obliged to carry him
                    down in a Canoe: As I found he intended to stay here a Day or two, and knew
                        that<person>Monsieur Joncaire</person> would employ every Scheme to set him
                    against the English as he had before done; I told him I hoped he would guard
                    against his Flattery, and let no fine Speeches influence him in their Fa- vour:
                    He desired I might not be concerned, for he knew the French too well, for any
                    Thing to engage him in their Behalf, and though he could not go down with us, he
                    would endeavour to meet at the Forks with Joseph Campbell, to deliver a Speech
                    for me to carry to his Honour the Governor. He told me he would order the young
                    Hunter to attend us, and get Provision,if wanted. </p>
                <p n="61">Our Horses were now so weak and feeble, and the Baggage heavy, as we here
                    obliged to provide all the Necessaries that the Journey would require; that we
                    doubted much their per- forming it: therefore myself and others (except the
                    Drivers which were obliged to ride) gave up our Horses for Packs, to assist
                    along with the Baggage ; I put myself in an Indian walk- ing Dress, and
                    continued with them three Days, till I found there was no Probability of their
                    getting in, in any reasonable Time ; the Horses grew less able to travel every
                    Day ; the Cold increased very fast, and the Roads were becoming much worse by a
                    deep Snow, continually freezing ; and as I was uneasy to get back, to make
                    Report of my Proceedings to his Honour the Governor, I determined to prosecute
                    my Journey the nearest Way through the Woods, on Foot.</p>
                <p n="62">Accordingly I left Mr. Vanbraam in Charge of our Baggage, with Money and
                    Directions, to provide Necessaries from Place to Place for themselves and
                    Horses, and to make the most con- venient Dispatch in. </p>
                <p n="63"> I took my necessary Papers, pulled off my Cloaths; tied myself up in a
                    Match Coat; and with my Pack at my Back with my Papers and Provisions in it, and
                    a Gun, set out with Mr. Gist, fitted in the same Manner, on Wednesday the 26th.
                    The Day following, just after we had passed a Place called the Murdering-Town,
                    where we intended to quit the Path, and steer across the Country for Shannapins
                    Town, we fell in with a Party of French Indians, who had lain in Wait for us;
                    one of them fired at Mr. Gist or me, not 15 Steps, but fortunately missed. We
                    took this fellow into Custody, and kept him till about 9 o’Clock at Night, and
                    then let him go, and walked all the remaining Part of the Night without making
                    any Stop, that we might get the Start, so far, as to be out of the Reach of
                    their Pursuit the next Day, as we were well assured they would follow our Tract
                    as soon as it was light : The next Day we con- tinued travelling till quite
                    dark, and got to the River about two Miles above Shannapins; we expected to have
                    found the River frozen, but it was not, only about 50 Yards from each Shore ;
                    the Ice I suppose had broke up above, for it was driving in vast Quantities. ish
                    ; I put out my setting Pole to try to stop the Raft, that the Ice might pass by,
                    when the Rapidity of the Stream threw it with so much Violence against the Pole,
                    that it jirked me out into ten Feet Water, but I fortunately saved myself by
                    catching hold of one of the Raft Logs ; notwithstanding all our Efforts we could
                    not get the Raft to either Shore, but were obliged, as we were near an Island,
                    to quit our Raft and make to it. </p>
                <p n="64">I enquir’d of Capt. Riparti about the Boy that was carried by, as it was

                    a Mile over. We did not reach Venango, till the 22d, where we met with our
                    Horses. by a deep Snow, continually freezing ; and as I was uneasy to get back,
                    to make Report of my Proceedings to his Honour the Governor, I determined to
                    prosecute my Journey the nearest Way through the Woods, on Foot. This Creek is
                    extremely crooked, I dare say the Distance between the Fort and Venango can’t be
                    less than 130 Miles, to follow the Meanders.</p>

                <p n="68"><date day="23" month="December" year="1753">23d.</date> When I got Things ready to set off, I sent for the Half-
                    King, to know whether he intended to go with us, or by Wa- ter, he told me that
                    White-Thunder had hurt himself much, and was sick and unable to walk, therefore
                    he was obliged to carry him down in a Canoe: As I found he intended to stay here
                    a Day or two, and knew that Monsieur Joncaire would employ every Scheme to set
                    him against the English as he had before done; I told him I hoped he would guard
                    against his Flattery, and let no fine Speeches influence him in their Fa- vour:
                    He desired I might not be concerned, for he knew the French too well, for any
                    Thing to engage him in their Behalf, and though he could not go down with us, he
                    would endeavour to meet at the Forks with Joseph Campbell, to deliver a Speech
                    for me to carry to his Honour the Governor. He told me he would order the young
                    Hunter to attend us, and get Provision,if wanted. </p>
                <p n="69">Our Horses were now so weak and feeble, and the Baggage heavy, as we here
                    obliged to provide all the Necessaries that the Journey would require; that we
                    doubted much their per- forming it: therefore myself and others (except the
                    Drivers which were obliged to ride) gave up our Horses for Packs, to assist
                    along with the Baggage ; I put myself in an Indian walk- ing Dress, and
                    continued with them three Days, till I found there was no Probability of their
                    getting in, in any reasonable Time ; the Horses grew less able to travel every
                    Day ; the Cold increased very fast, and the Roads were becoming much worse by a
                    deep Snow, continually freezing ; and as I was uneasy to get back, to make
                    Report of my Proceedings to his Honour the Governor, I determined to prosecute
                    my Journey the nearest Way through the Woods, on Foot. This Creek is extremely
                    crooked, I dare say the Distance between the Fort and Venango can’t be less than
                    130 Miles, to follow the Meanders. Accordingly I left Mr. Vanbraam in Charge of
                    our Baggage, with Money and Directions, to provide Necessaries from Place to
                    Place for themselves and Horses, and to make the most con- venient Dispatch
                    in.</p>
                <p n="70">I took my necessary Papers, pulled off my Cloaths; tied myself up in a
                    Match Coat; and with my Pack at my Back with my Papers and Provisions in it, and
                    a Gun, set out with Mr. Gist, fitted in the same Manner, on Wednesday the 26th.
                    The Day following, just after we had passed a Place called the Murdering-Town,
                    where we intended to quit the Path, and steer across the Country for Shannapins
                    Town, we fell in with a Party of French Indians, who had lain in Wait for us;
                    one of them fired at Mr. Gist or me, not 15 Steps, but fortunately missed. We
                    took this fellow into Custody, and kept him till about 9 o’Clock at Night, and
                    then let him go, and walked all the remaining Part of the Night without making
                    any Stop, that we might get the Start, so far, as to be out of the Reach of
                    their Pursuit the next Day, as we were well assured they would follow our Tract
                    as soon as it was light : The next Day we con- tinued travelling till quite
                    dark, and got to the River about two Miles above Shannapins; we expected to have
                    found the River frozen, but it was not, only about 50 Yards from each Shore ;
                    the Ice I suppose had broke up above, for it was driving in vast Quantities.
                    There was no Way for getting over but on a Raft, which we set about, with but
                    one poor Hatchet, and got finished just af- ter Sun-setting, after a whole Days
                    Work ; we got it launched, and on Board of it, and set off ; but before we were
                    Half Way over, we were jammed in the Ice in such a Manner that we ex- pected
                    every Moment our Raft to sink, and ourselves to perish ; I put out my setting
                    Pole to try to stop the Raft, that the Ice might pass by, when the Rapidity of
                    the Stream threw it with so much Violence against the Pole, that it jirked me
                    out into ten Feet Water, but I fortunately saved myself by catching hold of one
                    of the Raft Logs ; notwithstanding all our Efforts we could not get the Raft to
                    either Shore, but were obliged, as we were near an Island, to quit our Raft and
                    make to it. </p>
                <p n="71">The Cold was so extremely severe, that Mr. Gist, had all his Fingers, and
                    some of his Toes frozen, and the Water was shut up so hard, that we found no
                    Difficulty in getting off the Island, on the Ice, in the Morning, and went to
                        <place>Mr. Frazier’ s.</place> We met here with 20 Warriors who were going
                    to the Southward to War, but coming to a Place upon the Head of the great
                    Cunnaway, where they found seven People killed and scalped, all but one Woman
                    with very light Hair, they turned about and ran back, for Fear the
                        <people>Inhabitants</people>should rise and take them as the Authors of the
                    Murder : They re- port that the People were lying about the House, and some of
                    them much torn and eaten by Hogs: By the Marks that were left, they say they
                    were French Indians of the Ottaway Na- tion,that did it. </p>
                <p n="72">As we intended to take Horses here, and it required some Time to find
                    them, I went up about three Miles to the Mouth of Yaughyaughgane to visit Queen
                    Alliquippa, who had expressed great Concern that we passed her in going to the
                    Fort. I made her a Present of a Matchcoat and a Bottle of Rum, which lat- ter
                    was thought much the best Present of the two. </p>

                    Horses loaded with Materials and Stores for a Fort at the Forks of Ohio, and the
                    Day after some Families going out to settle : This Day we arrived at
                    Wills-Creek, after as fatiguing a Journey as it is pos- sible to conceive,
                    rendered so by excessive bad Weather : From the first Day of December to the
                    15th, there was but one Day but it rained or snowed incessantly ; and throughout
                    the whole Journey we met with nothing but one continued Series of cold wet
                    Weather, which occasioned very uncomfortable Lodgings, especially after we had
                    left our Tent, which was some Screen from the Inclemency of it.</p>
